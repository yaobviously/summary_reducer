This article discusses the concept of AI Go Foom, which is the idea that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could rapidly reach orders of magnitude more intelligence than humans in a matter of days or hours. It examines the potential dangers of this scenario, as well as the potential of using simulations to assess the risks. It also discusses the idea that human brains are riddled with cognitive biases, and argues that these biases will likely be reproduced in AGI. Finally, it quantizes intelligence power as the mutual information between an agent's potential current actions and future observable states of the world. The article concludes by noting that every year that passes without a "Foom" is further evidence against its possibility, as our human/AI cyborg civilization advances closer to the vast expanse of the pareto frontier.
