PROMPT:

The layers of argumentation pile up, and that particular question will probably never be settled. Nonetheless, the consilience approach carries one strong trump card: human beings are impatient and will probably never succeed in thinking purely about the long term. So the best we can hope to achieve, practically speaking, is to tie the long run to the short and medium runs as closely as possible. Even if consilience isn’t perfect, it is perhaps the best we are going to achieve. The longtermists ought to pocket that win, knowing that they will not get much further, at least not any time soon.
In this view long-term thinking is important, but primarily because it helps us to think more clearly about the short and medium term. Most of all, we need to look for agendas where there is considerable overlap when it comes to “what is best” across varied time horizons. But dangers lurk in this move as well. I’ve already mentioned that ostensibly long-termist agendas are often, in reality, primarily concerned with short-term political priorities. If the consilience versions of longtermism are those most likely to survive in the world of ideas, that will make it all the easier for longtermism to evolve into cloaked forms for shorter-term ambitions, dressed up in the proper analytical, rationalist language.
