Suddenly, however,he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry."The treasure is gone!" he said. "They have robbed him of thetreasure! There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped himto do it! I was the last person who saw him! I left him here lastnight, and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs.""What time was that?""It was ten o'clock. And now he is dead, and the police will becalled in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh,yes, I am sure I shall. But you don't think so, gentlemen? Surely youdon't think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought youhere if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!"He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsivefrenzy."You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto," said Holmes, kindly,putting his hand upon his shoulder. "Take my advice, and drive downto the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assistthem in every way. We shall wait here until your return."The
little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard himstumbling down the stairs in the dark. CHAPTER VI Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration"Now, Watson," said Holmes, rubbing his hands, "we have half an hourto ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have toldyou, almost complete; but we must not err on the side ofover-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be somethingdeeper underlying it.""Simple!" I ejaculated."Surely," said he, with something of the air of a clinical professorexpounding to his class. "Just sit in the corner there, that yourfootprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the firstplace, how did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has notbeen opened since last night. How of the window?" He carried the lampacross to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, butaddressing them to himself rather than to me. "Window is snibbed onthe inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let usopen it. No
water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man hasmounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is theprint of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddymark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. Seehere, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration."I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. "This is not afootmark," said I."It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of awooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy bootwith the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of thetimber-toe.""It is the wooden-legged man.""Quite so. But there has been some one else,--a very able andefficient ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?"I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly onthat angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground,and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as acrevice in the brick-work."It is absolutely impossible,"


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and Watson investigate a mysterious death at a house. Holmes deduces from the evidence that a wooden-legged man and an accomplice had broken into the house, stolen the treasure, and killed the occupant. Holmes advises the other man present to go to the police station and report the incident. He and Watson then use the remaining time to examine evidence, such as footprints and a wooden stump impression, in order to further their investigation.
