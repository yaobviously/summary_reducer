PROMPT:

As for the long term, we are told: “If we can just manage to keep our faith in gradual reform, who knows what we might achieve in the years to come?”. Gradual does not delve deep in its philosophizing, but it seems the authors have some version of a consilience view in mind: let’s do something good now and hope for the best. Who, after all, has a better and more easily implemented idea than that? The authors also cite “Amara’s Law”, named after the Stanford University computer scientist Roy Amara, which states that we habitually overestimate what a new technology can accomplish in the short run and underestimate what it can accomplish in the longer run. Berman and Fox’s core vision is that building for the longer run requires an incrementalist perspective.
While Gradual is the most practical and satisfying of the books under review, it is worth considering, as the authors do not, the cases in which an incrementalist view might fail us. Do we wish the architects of the Manhattan Project to have been incrementalist in their outlook? And what about Abraham Lincoln, who was at first an incrementalist on the slavery issue, but then realized that circumstances required something quite different? Where does a truly incrementalist society find the moral and emotional capital to support its revolutionaries in the times when those revolutionaries are needed? It may be that incrementalism requires a dose of the Fisher view, and its obsession with the longue durée, but how can a society manage that integration without giving up its beneficial incrementalist tendencies?

RESPONSE:

These are questions that Gradual does not answer, but they are worth considering.
