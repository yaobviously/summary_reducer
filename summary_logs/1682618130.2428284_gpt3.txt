PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

The idea of longtermism is that we should prioritize decisions and actions that will have the greatest positive impact on future generations. This means taking into account not only the immediate consequences of our actions, but also their long-term impacts. It also means considering the potential for our actions to have a lasting, positive effect on the environment, biodiversity, and climate change. In practical terms, this means making decisions with an eye to the future: investing in renewable energy sources, reducing emissions, preserving natural habitats, and so on. It also means considering how our current actions might affect future generations—for example, by investing in research and development that could lead to breakthroughs in clean energy or other technologies that could help mitigate climate change. Ultimately, longtermism is about recognizing our responsibility to future generations and taking steps to ensure that our actions today will benefit them tomorrow. We owe it to our descendants to make sure that we are doing all we can to protect the planet and its resources for them.
