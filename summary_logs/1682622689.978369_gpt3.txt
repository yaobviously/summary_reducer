Akbar, Mahomet, and myself."Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that myfriend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I'llmake it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, buthe never came back again. Captain Morstan showed me his name among alist of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards.His uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army,yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstanwent over to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, thatthe treasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all,without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold himthe secret. From that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of itby day and I nursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbingpassion with me. I cared nothing for the law,--nothing for thegallows. To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon histhroat,--that was my one thought.
Even the Agra treasure had come tobe a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto."Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never onewhich I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my timecame. I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. Oneday when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islanderwas picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death,and had gone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though hewas as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I gothim all right and able to walk. He took a kind of fancy to me then,and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging aboutmy hut. I learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made himall the fonder of me."Tonga--for that was his name--was a fine boatman, and owned a big,roomy canoe of his own. When I found that he was devoted to me andwould do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked itover with
him. He was to bring his boat round on a certain night toan old wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up.I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot ofyams, cocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes."He was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a morefaithful mate. At the night named he had his boat at the wharf. As itchanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,--avile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuringme. I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was asif fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before Ileft the island. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and hiscarbine on his shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out hisbrains with, but none could I see."Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I couldlay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped mywooden leg. With three long hops I was on him. He put his carbine
