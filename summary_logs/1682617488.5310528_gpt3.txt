PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is the belief that we should prioritize decisions with the greatest long-term impact, even if they come at a short-term cost. This means that, when making decisions, we should consider not only the immediate consequences but also the potential long-term effects. This could involve anything from investing in renewable energy sources to reducing consumption of single-use plastics. The idea is not new. Our ancestors have been making decisions with long-term impacts in mind for centuries, from conserving resources to building sustainable infrastructure. Unfortunately, many of these decisions were made without considering the potential long-term effects on climate change and biodiversity. In recent years, however, there has been a growing recognition of the need for more long-term thinking when it comes to environmental issues. Ultimately, it is up to us to decide how we want our descendants to remember us. Do we want them to look back at our actions and be proud of our commitment to preserving the planet for future generations? Or do we want them to look back and regret our failure to take action when we had the chance? The choice is ours.
