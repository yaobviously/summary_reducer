PROMPT:

Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.
But are the transnational organizations in our current world so far-sighted? Have not most of them collapsed or weakened greatly in recent years, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization? What exactly is supposed to protect these organizations from a more general and rampant short-sightedness? (They are, by the way, full of agency relationships as criticized above.) Furthermore, since most electorates are locally or nationally defined, it is hard to resist the suspicion that transnational institutions will be far from democratic. The European Union, for all its virtues and successes, does not escape this charge.

RESPONSE:

Zielonka’s book does not provide a full answer to these questions, but it does offer a starting point for further discussion. He argues that transnational organizations should be more transparent and accountable, and that they should focus on long-term goals rather than short-term gains. He also suggests that global governance should be based on the principles of subsidiarity, meaning that decisions should be made at the lowest level possible, and that global institutions should be built upon existing local and regional structures. In this way, transnational organizations can be made more responsive to local needs and interests. Finally, Zielonka calls for a new global ethic that recognizes our common humanity and shared responsibility for the planet. Ultimately, Zielonka's book is an attempt to provide an alternative vision of global governance to the one presented by Fisher. He argues that we must move beyond nation-states and empower public actors at the local and transnational level in order to address global challenges. His proposals are not without their flaws, but they offer a starting point for further discussion on how to create a more equitable and sustainable world.
