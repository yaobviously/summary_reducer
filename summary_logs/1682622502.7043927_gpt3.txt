classes begin to knowme,--especially since our friend here took to publishing some of mycases: so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguiselike this. You got my wire?""Yes; that was what brought me here.""How has your case prospered?""It has all come to nothing. I have had to release two of myprisoners, and there is no evidence against the other two.""Never mind. We shall give you two others in the place of them. Butyou must put yourself under my orders. You are welcome to all theofficial credit, but you must act on the line that I point out. Isthat agreed?""Entirely, if you will help me to the men.""Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat--asteam launch--to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o'clock.""That is easily managed. There is always one about there; but I canstep across the road and telephone to make sure.""Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.""There will be two or three in the boat. What else?""When we secure the
men we shall get the treasure. I think that itwould be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to theyoung lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be thefirst to open it.--Eh, Watson?""It would be a great pleasure to me.""Rather an irregular proceeding," said Jones, shaking his head."However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink atit.

I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something alittle choice in white wines.--Watson, you have never yet recognizedmy merits as a housekeeper."

I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke ona quick succession of subjects,--on miracle-plays, on medievalpottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and onthe war-ships of the future,--handling each as though he had made aspecial study of it. His bright humor marked the reaction from hisblack depression of the preceding days.

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and Athelney Jones agree to work together to capture Jonathan Small, who is suspected of stealing a valuable treasure. Holmes arranges for a fast police-boat to be at Westminster Stairs at seven o'clock and for two strong men to be available in case of resistance. He also suggests that the treasure be given to the rightful owner, a young lady, when they capture Small. The trio then enjoy a dinner of oysters and grouse before setting out on their mission.
