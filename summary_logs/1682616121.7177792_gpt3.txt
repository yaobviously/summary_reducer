PROMPT:

A better argument would be that the agency relationship (and habitual firing for inferior short-term performance), rather than capitalism, leads to excess short-termism. Capitalism has plenty of agency relationships, of course, but so do all other systems, including politics and the charitable sector. At least under capitalism there is an incentive to terminate or alter the most destructive agency relationships, precisely because they reduce longer-term wealth. As for the negative externalities of capitalism, for example in the form of carbon emissions, regulation is needed to solve those problems, not more patient behaviour in the markets; and in that sense the issue is not one of short- vs longtermism at all.
Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.

RESPONSE:

A better argument would be that the world is facing a range of complex and interconnected challenges that require more than just a shift in the balance of power between nation-states and other public actors. To address these challenges, we need to rethink the way we approach global governance, and recognize that it must be based on an understanding of the interdependence of different actors and interests. This means creating new forms of collaboration between nation-states, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector, as well as developing new mechanisms for global coordination and collective decision-making. We also need to ensure that global governance is inclusive and equitable, and that it takes into account the rights and interests of all stakeholders. Finally, we must recognize that these challenges cannot be solved through short-term solutions; instead, we need to focus on building long-term resilience and sustainability.
