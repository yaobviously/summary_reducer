He handed them a shillingeach, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a momentlater streaming down the street."If the launch is above water they will find her," said Holmes, as herose from the table and lit his pipe. "They can go everywhere, seeeverything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening thatthey have spotted her. In the mean while, we can do nothing but awaitresults. We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either theAurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith.""Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are you going to bed,Holmes?""No: I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never rememberfeeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I amgoing to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fairclient has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of oursought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other manmust, I should think, be absolutely unique.""That other man again!""I have no wish to make a
mystery of him,--to you, anyway. But youmust have formed your own opinion. Now, do consider the data.Diminutive footmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet,stone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts. Whatdo you make of all this?""A savage!" I exclaimed. "Perhaps one of those Indians who were theassociates of Jonathan Small.""Hardly that," said he. "When first I saw signs of strange weapons Iwas inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of thefootmarks caused me to reconsider my views. Some of the inhabitantsof the Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left suchmarks as that. The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. Thesandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from theothers, because the thong is commonly passed between. These littledarts, too, could only be shot in one way. They are from a blow-pipe.Now, then, where are we to find our savage?""South American," I hazarded.He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky

RESPONSE:

Holmes and Watson are discussing a case involving a wooden-legged man and another man of small stature. Holmes believes that the two men are connected in some way and speculates that they must be unique individuals. He suggests that they send out two men to search for the Aurora, which may help them find the other man. In order to find out more about the other man, Holmes looks up information in a gazetteer and discovers that the aborigines of the Andaman Islands are known for being the smallest race on earth and for having large, misshapen heads and small, fierce personalities.
