PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

==========

RESPONSE:

Yes, absolutely. Our ancestors may not have had the knowledge or technology to understand the full implications of their decisions, but that doesn't excuse us from taking responsibility for our actions today. We must think beyond our own lifetimes and consider the long-term impacts of our decisions on future generations. We owe it to our descendants to make decisions that are sustainable and beneficial for the planet, and that will ensure a brighter future for humanity.
