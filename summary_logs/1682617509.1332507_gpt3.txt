PROMPT:

But before we let that satisfy us, we need to ask whether talent and good institutions should always be the priority for dealing with longer-term and existential risks. And are there any downsides to these apparently beneficial things? Let us consider, for example, a biomedical research centre that studies immunology and produces frontier-level scientific innovation. One might argue that the best thing to do with such a centre would be to invest in and expand, it. Many longtermists are, however, less certain. They fear that superior knowledge of the human immune system will at some point enable terrorists or evil governments to design a deadly pathogen, able, for example, to go far beyond Covid in its carnage. And some suggest that humanity should stop research into frontier-level immunology altogether.
The counter-argument runs thus: even if we fear advances in immunology, is it not better for non-rogue actors to have the greatest understanding possible? Would it not, more simply, be better for the West to be ahead of China and Russia in this field? Might the West not need superior immunology to fend off a terror attack one day? And what of those potential rogue actors who are not ceasing their own research? Above all, what would it be like to have a government that banned an entire scientific field? And might science as a whole then stagnate, stifling our ability to divert that large asteroid heading towards the planet? (A version of this debate recently erupted when more than 1,000 artificial-intelligence experts and investors, including Elon Musk, signed an open letter calling on scientists to pause their work on large-language AI models such as ChatGPT-4 for six months. They wrote: “Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable”.)

RESPONSE:

The debate around these issues is complex and far from settled. But it is clear that, in the long run, we must think carefully about the implications of investing in and expanding certain scientific fields. We must consider the potential benefits as well as the potential risks. We must also consider the need to balance our desire for innovation with our need for safety and security. Ultimately, we must strive to ensure that our decisions are informed by both short-term and long-term thinking, and that they are made with both caution and ambition.
