PROMPT:

A better argument would be that the agency relationship (and habitual firing for inferior short-term performance), rather than capitalism, leads to excess short-termism. Capitalism has plenty of agency relationships, of course, but so do all other systems, including politics and the charitable sector. At least under capitalism there is an incentive to terminate or alter the most destructive agency relationships, precisely because they reduce longer-term wealth. As for the negative externalities of capitalism, for example in the form of carbon emissions, regulation is needed to solve those problems, not more patient behaviour in the markets; and in that sense the issue is not one of short- vs longtermism at all.
Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.

RESPONSE:

This is a call for more democracy, not more patient behaviour in the markets. The argument here is that the problems of short-termism are not necessarily due to capitalism, but rather to agency relationships and the lack of regulation. The book's remedies are thus focused on increasing democracy and empowering public actors at the local and transnational level. This would help to reduce the negative externalities of capitalism, such as carbon emissions, and create incentives to terminate or alter destructive agency relationships. In this way, regulation could be used to address the issue of short-termism, rather than relying on patient behaviour in the markets.
