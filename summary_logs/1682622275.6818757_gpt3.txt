his very lips at the moment that he died. Wecould judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet whichhe had taken out. Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I hadsome little discussion. The pearls were evidently of great value, andhe was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother washimself a little inclined to my father's fault. He thought, too, thatif we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip andfinally bring us into trouble. It was all that I could do to persuadehim to let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detachedpearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feeldestitute.""It was a kindly thought," said our companion, earnestly. "It wasextremely good of you."The little man waved his hand deprecatingly. "We were your trustees,"he said. "That was the view which I took of it, though BrotherBartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. We had plentyof money ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it
would have beensuch bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion.'Le mauvais got mne au crime.' The French have a very neat way ofputting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject wentso far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself: so I leftPondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me.Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance hasoccurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicatedwith Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwoodand demand our share. I explained my views last night to BrotherBartholomew: so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors."Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurioussettee.

make you some small return bythrowing some light upon that which is still dark to you. But, asMiss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put thematter through without delay."Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of hishookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befroggedtopcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up,in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished hisattire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets whichcovered the ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobileand peaky face. "My health is somewhat fragile," he remarked, as heled the way down the passage. "I am compelled to be avaletudinarian."Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidentlyprearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace.Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high abovethe rattle of the wheels."Bartholomew is a clever fellow," said he.
