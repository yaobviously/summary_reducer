Write a detailed summary of the following:


There is a more prosaic version of longtermism. In most western nations current politicians seem less concerned with mounting debts and falling fertility rates than perhaps they ought to be. Common sense suggests that we should look ahead ten or twenty years and consider whether  to cite one mainstream example  the fiscal position of the United Kingdom is sustainable, given current productivity growth rates, which often verge on zero or are negative. In a given year a small boost to the rate of economic growth may not do much for human happiness, but compounded over decades or centuries it will become very large indeed. A country that grows at 1 per cent per annum will double its measured living standards every seventy years; a country that grows at 7 per cent will double its living standards roughly every decade. If you play that difference out for a few decades it ends up being substantial  a point laid out in my book Stubborn Attachments (2018). But that argument is a tough sell for politicians with pending re-elections, and to voters with pressing needs and short attention spans.
The broader pushback against longtermism is increasingly fierce. The philosopher mile P. Torres wrote a polemic for Aeon, Against longtermism (October 19, 2021), which described the movement as both richly funded and quite possibly the most dangerous secular belief system in the world today. Torress fear, quite simply, is that longtermism can too frequently be used to obliterate the demands of the present and ignore the suffering of todays individuals. This critique comes primarily from the political left, which commonly cites instances of human suffering to which, it is argued, the polity is obliged to respond. But in the longtermist framework this argument can never be the full picture, and there are always reasons to limit our obligations to those who are suffering today. Alleviation may help individuals in the short run, but more collective good might be done by allocating resources to innovation or disaster mitigation, such as protecting the Earth against an asteroid hit. Perhaps the long term is intrinsically difficult to predict, but that in turn means our obligations to the present become highly uncertain, because the pull of potential future benefits is never absent from our calculations.
I have found that many advocates of longtermism favour the analytic mode and consequently de- emphasize the empathetic mode of political argument. That is one reason why longtermism is so controversial. The complicated nature of long-term arguments means that they are most commonly put forward by people with analytical inclinations. The kinds of arguments and discourse that are corralled in support of longtermism emerge from fields such as economics, rational choice theory and ethics, game theory and analytic philosophy. That may be a bug or a feature, depending on your point of view. Either way, the true disagreements over longtermism, as with most political concerns, remain foundationally rooted in our emotions and our personal temperaments.


DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is a concept that suggests looking at the long-term effects of current decisions, such as the sustainability of a country's fiscal position given current productivity growth. It suggests that small boosts to economic growth may not have an immediate effect, but will be compounded over time, leading to significant increases in living standards. However, this concept has been met with pushback from the political left, who argue that it ignores the suffering of today's individuals. Philosopher Mile P. Torres wrote an article criticizing longtermism as a dangerous belief system. He argued that it can be used to ignore the demands of the present and ignore human suffering. On the other hand, advocates of longtermism tend to de-emphasize the empathetic mode of political argument and rely more on analytical arguments from fields like economics, rational choice theory and ethics, game theory and analytic philosophy. Ultimately, disagreements over longtermism are rooted in emotions and personal temperaments.
