shawl. He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his handstwitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left andright with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when heventures out from his hole. It gave me the chills to think of killinghim, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as aflint within me. When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrupof joy and came running up towards me."'Your protection, Sahib,' he panted,--'your protection for theunhappy merchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that Imight seek the shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed andbeaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company. Itis a blessed night this when I am once more in safety,--I and my poorpossessions.'"'What have you in the bundle?' I asked."'An iron box,' he answered, 'which contains one or two little familymatters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorryto lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall
reward you, young Sahib,and your governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.'"I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man. The more Ilooked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that weshould slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over."'Take him to the main guard,' said I. The two Sikhs closed in uponhim on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched inthrough the dark gate-way. Never was a man so compassed round withdeath. I remained at the gate-way with the lantern."I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding throughthe lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and ascuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to myhorror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loudbreathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long,straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind,with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels,bounding like a
tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knifeflashing in his hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as thatlittle merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that ifhe once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet.My heart softened to him, but again the thought of his treasureturned me hard and bitter. I cast my firelock between his legs as heraced past, and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he couldstagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twicein his side. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but laywere he had fallen. I think myself that he may have broken his neckwith the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. I amtelling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened,whether it is in my favor or not."He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-waterwhich Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had nowconceived the utmost horror of the man,
