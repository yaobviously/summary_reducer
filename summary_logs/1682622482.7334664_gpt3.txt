nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening theStandard, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to thebusiness."With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy," it remarked, "we havereason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complexand mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shownthat it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have beenin any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs.Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed,however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, andthat it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard,with all his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may beexpected at any moment.""That is satisfactory so far as it goes," thought I. "Friend Sholtois safe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though itseems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made ablunder."I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at
that moment my eyecaught an advertisement in the agony column. It ran in this way:"Lost.--Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, leftSmith's Wharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in thesteam launch Aurora, black with two red stripes, funnel black with awhite band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who cangive information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith's Wharf, or at 221b BakerStreet, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and thelaunch Aurora."This was clearly Holmes's doing.

theill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could therebe, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning. Mighthe be suffering from some huge self-deception? Was it not possiblethat his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theoryupon faulty premises? I had never known him to be wrong; and yet thekeenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived. He was likely, Ithought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of hislogic,--his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when aplainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on theother hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard thereasons for his deductions. When I looked back on the long chain ofcurious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but alltending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself thateven if Holmes's explanation were incorrect the true theory must beequally outr and startling.At three o'clock in the afternoon there was

RESPONSE:

The Upper Norwood tragedy is proving to be more complex and mysterious than originally thought, with fresh evidence showing that Thaddeus Sholto could not have been involved. Scotland Yard is pursuing a clue as to the real culprits, while Sherlock Holmes has placed an advertisement in the agony column offering a reward for information on the whereabouts of Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora. The long day passes with no news, and Sherlock's companion, Dr. Watson, begins to wonder if his reasoning may be flawed.
