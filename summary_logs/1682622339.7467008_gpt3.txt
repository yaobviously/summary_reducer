as the old writerscalled it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?""Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid," I answered,--"somestrychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.""That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawnmuscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked forthe means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, Idiscovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great forceinto the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which wouldbe turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect inhis chair. Now examine the thorn."I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It waslong, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as thoughsome gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had beentrimmed and rounded off with a knife."Is that an English thorn?" he asked."No, it certainly is not.""With all these data you should be able to draw some just
inference.But here are the regulars: so the auxiliary forces may beat aretreat."As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly onthe passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strodeheavily into the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with apair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out frombetween swollen and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by aninspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto."Here's a business!" he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. "Here's apretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be asfull as a rabbit-warren!""I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones," said Holmes,quietly."Why, of course I do!" he wheezed. "It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, thetheorist. Remember you! I'll never forget how you lectured us all oncauses and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It'strue you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it wasmore by good luck than
good guidance.""It was a piece of very simple reasoning.""Oh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to own up. But what is allthis? Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,--no room fortheories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over anothercase! I was at the station when the message arrived. What d'you thinkthe man died of?""Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over," said Holmes,dryly."No, no. Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the headsometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half amillion missing. How was the window?""Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.""Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to dowith the matter. That's common sense. Man might have died in a fit;but then the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashescome upon me at times.--Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr.Sholto. Your friend can remain.--What do you think of this, Holmes?Sholto was, on his own confession, with his

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes is called to investigate a mysterious death in which the man was found with drawn muscles on his face. Upon examining the scene, Holmes finds a thorn with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried on it. He theorizes that the man died from a powerful vegetable alkaloid, like strychnine, which was administered through the thorn. He is then joined by Inspector Athelney Jones and Thaddeus Sholto, and they discuss the case and possible theories.
