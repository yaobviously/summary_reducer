strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light fromwithin, I think.""None," said Holmes. "But I see the glint of a light in that littlewindow beside the door.""Ah, that is the housekeeper's room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstonesits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mindwaiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together andshe has no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what isthat?"He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of lightflickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, andwe all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the greatblack house there sounded through the silent night the saddest andmost pitiful of sounds,--the shrill, broken whimpering of afrightened woman."It is Mrs. Bernstone," said Sholto. "She is the only woman in thehouse. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment." He hurried for thedoor, and knocked in his peculiar way. We could see a tall old womanadmit him, and
sway with pleasure at the very sight of him."Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad youhave come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!" We heard her reiterated rejoicingsuntil the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffledmonotone.Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round, andpeered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps whichcumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her handwas in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we twowho had never seen each other before that day, between whom no wordor even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour oftrouble our hands instinctively sought for each other. I havemarvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most naturalthing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me,there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort andprotection. So we stood hand in hand, like two children, and therewas peace in our hearts
for all the dark things that surrounded us."What a strange place!" she said, looking round."It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose init. I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill nearBallarat, where the prospectors had been at work.""And from the same cause," said Holmes. "These are the traces of thetreasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years lookingfor it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit."At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholtocame running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in hiseyes."There is something amiss with Bartholomew!" he cried. "I amfrightened! My nerves cannot stand it." He was, indeed, halfblubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out fromthe great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of aterrified child."Come into the house," said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way."Yes, do!" pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. "I really do not feel equal
