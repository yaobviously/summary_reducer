PROMPT:

But before we let that satisfy us, we need to ask whether talent and good institutions should always be the priority for dealing with longer-term and existential risks. And are there any downsides to these apparently beneficial things? Let us consider, for example, a biomedical research centre that studies immunology and produces frontier-level scientific innovation. One might argue that the best thing to do with such a centre would be to invest in and expand, it. Many longtermists are, however, less certain. They fear that superior knowledge of the human immune system will at some point enable terrorists or evil governments to design a deadly pathogen, able, for example, to go far beyond Covid in its carnage. And some suggest that humanity should stop research into frontier-level immunology altogether.
The counter-argument runs thus: even if we fear advances in immunology, is it not better for non-rogue actors to have the greatest understanding possible? Would it not, more simply, be better for the West to be ahead of China and Russia in this field? Might the West not need superior immunology to fend off a terror attack one day? And what of those potential rogue actors who are not ceasing their own research? Above all, what would it be like to have a government that banned an entire scientific field? And might science as a whole then stagnate, stifling our ability to divert that large asteroid heading towards the planet? (A version of this debate recently erupted when more than 1,000 artificial-intelligence experts and investors, including Elon Musk, signed an open letter calling on scientists to pause their work on large-language AI models such as ChatGPT-4 for six months. They wrote: “Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable”.)

RESPONSE:

The answer to this debate is not simple. On the one hand, it is important to recognize that some scientific fields have the potential to be extremely dangerous if they fall into the wrong hands. On the other hand, it is also important to recognize that halting research into a field altogether may have unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and allowing other countries to gain a competitive advantage. It is therefore essential that governments, researchers, and citizens come together to discuss the risks and rewards of advancing certain scientific fields before making any decisions. This could involve setting up a regulatory framework for research that includes risk assessment and management, as well as monitoring and enforcement measures. Additionally, governments should ensure that scientists are trained in ethical considerations when conducting research, and that they are held accountable for any potential misuse of their work. Ultimately, it is up to all of us to ensure that science is used for the benefit of humanity, not for its destruction.
