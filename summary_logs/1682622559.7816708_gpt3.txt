alreadynearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moonglimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnantwater and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thudran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flushwith the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sankits whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled andwrithed. Not one step could he possibly take either forwards orbackwards. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically intothe mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his woodenpin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launchalongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing theend of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out,and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths,father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meeklyenough when commanded. The Aurora herself we hauled off and

There was no key,but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully toour own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, weflashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign ofthe Islander.

The scene is set in a desolate marshland where a fugitive has been caught. He is unable to move forward or backward due to his stump being stuck in the mud. The two Smiths, father and son, are captured and brought aboard the launch. An iron chest of Indian workmanship is found on the deck and transferred to the cabin. Despite searching with a searchlight, the Islander is not found, but a dart is discovered which had almost hit Holmes and Watson. The captive is described as a sunburned man with a net-work of lines and wrinkles over his mahogany features, aged around fifty with black curly hair shot with gray. He sits in the cabin with his handcuffed hands on his lap, looking at the box which had caused his ill-doings, with a mixture of sorrow and anger on his face.
