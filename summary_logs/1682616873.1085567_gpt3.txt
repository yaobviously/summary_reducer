PROMPT:

Maybe local government is a better option, but it often has fewer resources and less talent, and is further removed from the cutting edge of science. As long as federal systems also exist, this is likely to remain the case. There are two pages of examples in Zielonka’s book about how to get local politics right, ranging from greater reliance on institutions such as the municipal council of Barcelona (a declining city by various metrics, including growth and investment, according to an article in the Financial Times on February 9, 2023) to the idea of a second chamber for the European parliament, comprising representatives of cities. Another idea he suggests is that “speakers at World Climate Summits could be selected by environmental NGOs and not the hosting governments”. But are we really supposed to think that this will make a significant, or even any, difference to the world’s biggest long-term problems? Whatever the virtues of longtermism may be, the doctrine is especially vulnerable to being commandeered into the favoured political cause of the day. Zielonka’s book shows just how fragile a doctrine longtermism is in the real worlds of fractious politics.
In Gradual: The case for incremental change in a radical age, Greg Berman and Aubrey Fox have produced the most mainstream, and credible, book of the three. The authors essentially, and persuasively, defend the benefits of muddling through. Their successful examples include US Social Security reform, the reduction of crime in New York City and the hidden strengths of the US immigration system. For all the talk of governance failures, the country seems to have a (relatively) workable retirement system, has made some significant strides against crime and continues to attract many of the most talented immigrants. Each of those achievements is the result of many small policy improvements over time, often unheralded during their implementation. Above all, and as its subtitle suggests, the book is a defence of such incremental reforms. Even the US Congress, it transpires, has been passing a surprising amount of bipartisan legislation in recent years, including on matters such as climate change (for example, the Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021).

RESPONSE:

The authors’ argument is that incremental change is often the most effective way of achieving long-term goals. They point to the example of the US Social Security system, which has been incrementally improved over time to become a successful and popular retirement system. They also argue that incremental change can be more politically feasible than radical change, since it requires fewer resources and less disruption. This is especially true in complex systems, such as healthcare or immigration, where radical change can have unintended consequences. They also point out that incrementalism can be more effective in the long run, since it allows for a more gradual adjustment to changing circumstances. Ultimately, Gradual: The case for incremental change in a radical age provides a compelling case for why incrementalism is often the best option for achieving long-term goals. It shows how incrementalism can be more effective than radical change in complex systems, and how it can be politically feasible even in times of great upheaval. It also provides a useful reminder that long-term goals are often best achieved through small steps taken over time.
