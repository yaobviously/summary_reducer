not only for thiscold-blooded business in which he had been concerned, but even morefor the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it.Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expectno sympathy from me. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their handsupon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the samedisgust written upon their faces.He may have observed it, for therewas a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded."It was all very bad, no doubt," said he. "I should like to know howmany fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot whenthey knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains.Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If hehad got out, the whole business would come to light, and I shouldhave been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people werenot very lenient at a time like that.""Go on with your story," said Holmes, shortly."Well, we carried him in,
Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight hewas, too, for all that he was so short. Mahomet Singh was left toguard the door. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had alreadyprepared. It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads toa great empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling topieces. The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a naturalgrave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered himover with loose bricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure."It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. The boxwas the same which now lies open upon your table. A key was hung by asilken cord to that carved handle upon the top.

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and Jones were listening to a man explain how he and two others had stolen a chest of jewels. He explains that they had to kill the merchant who owned the jewels in order to get away with them. He also explains that they found one hundred and forty-three diamonds, ninety-seven emeralds, one hundred and seventy rubies, forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats'-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, and nearly three hundred very fine pearls. He then goes on to say that they had all taken an oath to keep the secret and hide the loot until the country was at peace.
