eyes."Well, Jonathan Small," said Holmes, lighting a cigar, "I am sorrythat it has come to this.""And so am I, sir," he answered, frankly. "I don't believe that I canswing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I neverraised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tongawho shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir.I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted thelittle devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done,and I could not undo it again.""Have a cigar," said Holmes; "and you had best take a pull out of myflask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak aman as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him whileyou were climbing the rope?""You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. Thetruth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits ofthe house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usuallywent down to his supper. I shall make no
secret of the business. Thebest defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it hadbeen the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. Iwould have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar.But it's cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto,with whom I had no quarrel whatever.""You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. Heis going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a trueaccount of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if youdo I hope that I may be of use to you.I think I can prove that thepoison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reachedthe room.""That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I sawhim grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed throughthe window. It fairly shook me, sir. I'd have half killed Tonga forit if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave hisclub, and some of his darts too, as he tells
me, which I dare sayhelped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is morethan I can tell. I don't feel no malice against you for it. But itdoes seem a queer thing," he added, with a bitter smile, "that I whohave a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spendthe first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, andam like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was anevil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmetand had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anythingbut a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder,to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slaveryfor life."At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavyshoulders into the tiny cabin. "Quite a family party," he remarked."I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes.Well, I think wemay all congratulate each other. Pity we didn't take the other alive;but there was no choice. I say,

RESPONSE:

Holmes is talking to Jonathan Small, who is accused of murdering Major Sholto. Small insists he had nothing to do with it, and blames the murder on a small man named Tonga. Holmes offers Small a cigar and a drink from his flask, and then explains that Small could not have expected such a small man as Tonga to overpower Major Sholto. Small then admits to Holmes that he was hoping to find the room empty when he entered, and that he would have killed Major Sholto if it had been the old major. They are then interrupted by Athelney Jones of Scotland Yard, who suggests that they all congratulate each other for capturing the suspect.
