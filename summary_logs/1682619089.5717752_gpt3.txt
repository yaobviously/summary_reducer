Write a detailed summary of the following:


Maybe local government is a better option, but it often has fewer resources and less talent, and is further removed from the cutting edge of science. As long as federal systems also exist, this is likely to remain the case. There are two pages of examples in Zielonkas book about how to get local politics right, ranging from greater reliance on institutions such as the municipal council of Barcelona (a declining city by various metrics, including growth and investment, according to an article in the Financial Times on February 9, 2023) to the idea of a second chamber for the European parliament, comprising representatives of cities. Another idea he suggests is that speakers at World Climate Summits could be selected by environmental NGOs and not the hosting governments. But are we really supposed to think that this will make a significant, or even any, difference to the worlds biggest long-term problems? Whatever the virtues of longtermism may be, the doctrine is especially vulnerable to being commandeered into the favoured political cause of the day. Zielonkas book shows just how fragile a doctrine longtermism is in the real worlds of fractious politics.
In Gradual: The case for incremental change in a radical age, Greg Berman and Aubrey Fox have produced the most mainstream, and credible, book of the three. The authors essentially, and persuasively, defend the benefits of muddling through. Their successful examples include US Social Security reform, the reduction of crime in New York City and the hidden strengths of the US immigration system. For all the talk of governance failures, the country seems to have a (relatively) workable retirement system, has made some significant strides against crime and continues to attract many of the most talented immigrants. Each of those achievements is the result of many small policy improvements over time, often unheralded during their implementation. Above all, and as its subtitle suggests, the book is a defence of such incremental reforms. Even the US Congress, it transpires, has been passing a surprising amount of bipartisan legislation in recent years, including on matters such as climate change (for example, the Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021).
As for the long term, we are told: If we can just manage to keep our faith in gradual reform, who knows what we might achieve in the years to come?. Gradual does not delve deep in its philosophizing, but it seems the authors have some version of a consilience view in mind: lets do something good now and hope for the best. Who, after all, has a better and more easily implemented idea than that? The authors also cite Amaras Law, named after the Stanford University computer scientist Roy Amara, which states that we habitually overestimate what a new technology can accomplish in the short run and underestimate what it can accomplish in the longer run. Berman and Foxs core vision is that building for the longer run requires an incrementalist perspective.


DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In Gradual: The case for incremental change in a radical age, authors Greg Berman and Aubrey Fox make the case for muddling through as a viable approach to tackling big problems. They point to successful examples such as US Social Security reform, the reduction of crime in New York City and the hidden strengths of the US immigration system, which have been achieved through many small policy improvements over time. The authors argue that Congress has been passing a surprising amount of bipartisan legislation in recent years, including on matters such as climate change, and suggest that if we keep faith in gradual reform, we can achieve great things in the future. They cite Amaras Law, which states that we habitually overestimate what a new technology can accomplish in the short run and underestimate what it can accomplish in the longer run, and argue that building for the longer run requires an incrementalist perspective. In contrast, Zielonkas book looks at how fragile a doctrine longtermism is in the real world of fractious politics. He provides two pages of examples of how to get local politics right, ranging from greater reliance on institutions such as municipal councils to the idea of a second chamber for the European parliament. He also suggests that speakers at World Climate Summits could be selected by environmental NGOs rather than hosting governments. However, he acknowledges that this may not make a significant difference to the world's biggest long-term problems.
