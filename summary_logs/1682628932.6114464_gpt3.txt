In this chapter of the novel, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer devise a plan to help Jim, a runaway slave, escape from slavery. They come up with a plan to steal the key to the hut where Jim is being held, and then use a canoe and a raft to escape down the river. They also discuss using fox-fire to help them see while they dig. Along the way, they encounter the King and Duke who had been exploiting them for their own gain, but eventually reconcile and fall asleep in each other's arms, giving Huck and Jim a chance to talk about their situation and plan for the future.
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn devise a plan to help Jim, a runaway slave, escape captivity. They use a variety of tactics, including disguises and false keys, to help Jim escape. They also make a rope ladder out of their sheets, gather other items such as tin plates and a white shirt to help Jim escape, and create a witch-pie for the hounds that are guarding Jim. After sneaking out of the house, they make their way to the lean-to where Jim is waiting for them and use a grindstone from the mill to carve a 'mournful inscription' into a rock and make tools for their escape. In the end, Jim is able to escape successfully with the help of Tom Sawyer and Huck.
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, two young boys, successfully free Jim, a runaway slave, from captivity. With the help of Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas, they are rewarded with forty dollars for their faithful service. Tom then suggests they all go on an adventure to the Indian Territory, and reveals that his Pap has left six thousand dollars behind. With this money, the three of them embark on their two-week adventure. Along the way, they come across a village and Huck goes to find a doctor to help Tom, who has been shot in the leg. When they get back to the village, Huck is surprised to find his uncle there. He lies about where they have been and they all go back home, where Aunt Sally is relieved to see them. However, Jim is captured and taken back to the cabin he was held in before, but the old doctor defends his character and he is eventually returned with more chains.
