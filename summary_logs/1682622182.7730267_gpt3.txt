watch without them. He winds it at night, and heleaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in allthis?""It is as clear as daylight," I answered. "I regret the injusticewhich I did you. I should have had more faith in your marvellousfaculty. May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on footat present?""None. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brain-work. What elseis there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such adreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirlsdown the street and drifts across the duncolored houses. What couldbe more hopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of havingpowers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crimeis commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save thosewhich are commonplace have any function upon earth."I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crispknock our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver."A young lady for
you, sir," she said, addressing my companion."Miss Mary Morstan," he read. "Hum! I have no recollection of thename. Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson. Don't go, doctor. Ishould prefer that you remain." CHAPTER II The Statement of the CaseMiss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outwardcomposure of manner. She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, wellgloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, aplainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it asuggestion of limited means. The dress was a sombre grayish beige,untrimmed and unbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dullhue, relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side. Herface had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, buther expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes weresingularly spiritual and sympathetic. In an experience of women whichextends over many nations and three separate continents, I have neverlooked upon a face
which gave a clearer promise of a refined andsensitive nature. I could not but observe that as she took the seatwhich Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lip trembled, her handquivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation."I have come to you, Mr. Holmes," she said, "because you once enabledmy employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domesticcomplication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.""Mrs. Cecil Forrester," he repeated thoughtfully. "I believe that Iwas of some slight service to her. The case, however, as I rememberit, was a very simple one.""She did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine.I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterlyinexplicable, than the situation in which I find myself."Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened. He leaned forward inhis chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon hisclear-cut, hawklike features. "State your case," said he, in brisk,business tones.I
