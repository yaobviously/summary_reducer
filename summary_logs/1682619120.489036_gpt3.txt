Write a detailed summary of the following:


Longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, which questions why our ancestors did not take into account the long-term effects of their decisions on climate change and biodiversity. The effective altruism movement has recently been pushing for this concept to be taken more seriously, and it is a key theme in William MacAskill's book, What We Owe the Future. Longtermism suggests that we should be thinking about the potential human future with billions or even trillions of sentient beings, humans or their offshoots, colonizing the galaxy and continuing to evolve for millions or billions of years. This means that we should be focused on reducing existential risk, such as those posed by nuclear weapons or runaway artificial intelligence, in order to ensure that this future comes to fruition. Our descendants are relying on us to make the right decisions now in order to ensure their future.
Longtermism is a concept that suggests looking at the long-term effects of current decisions, such as the sustainability of a country's fiscal position given current productivity growth. It suggests that small boosts to economic growth may not have an immediate effect, but will be compounded over time, leading to significant increases in living standards. However, this concept has been met with pushback from the political left, who argue that it ignores the suffering of today's individuals. Philosopher Mile P. Torres wrote an article criticizing longtermism as a dangerous belief system. He argued that it can be used to ignore the demands of the present and ignore human suffering. On the other hand, advocates of longtermism tend to de-emphasize the empathetic mode of political argument and rely more on analytical arguments from fields like economics, rational choice theory and ethics, game theory and analytic philosophy. Ultimately, disagreements over longtermism are rooted in emotions and personal temperaments.
The right wing has its own version of scepticism about longtermism, which they view as a programme for maximizing state power and creating world government in pursuit of distant, ill-defined benefits that may never come to pass. The left and right critiques may sound different, but both question whether longtermists are even capable of longtermism themselves. Another practical question is how much longtermism truly changes our decision calculus. One response is to argue that the best preparation for the long run is to invest in human talent, high-quality institutions, and flexible responses today. This closes the gap between long-, medium-, and short-run considerations, as these investments should help with current problems as well. However, one must consider the potential downsides of these investments, such as a biomedical research centre that could enable terrorists or evil governments to design deadly pathogens. Some suggest that humanity should stop research into frontier-level immunology altogether.

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is a radical philosophy that questions why our ancestors did not take into account the long-term effects of their decisions on climate change and biodiversity. The effective altruism movement has recently been advocating for this concept to be taken more seriously, and it is a key theme in William MacAskill's book, What We Owe the Future. Longtermism suggests that we should be focused on reducing existential risk, such as those posed by nuclear weapons or runaway artificial intelligence, in order to ensure that a future with billions or even trillions of sentient beings comes to fruition. However, this concept has been met with pushback from both the political left and right. Those on the left argue that it ignores the suffering of today's individuals, while those on the right view it as a programme for maximizing state power and creating world government. Practically, one must consider how much longtermism truly changes our decision calculus. Some suggest that investing in human talent, high-quality institutions, and flexible responses today is the best preparation for the long run, though one must consider the potential downsides of such investments. Others argue that humanity should stop research into frontier-level immunology altogether. Ultimately, disagreements over longtermism are rooted in emotions and personal temperaments.
