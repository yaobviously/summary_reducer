PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

Yes, I do wish that our ancestors had cared more about the long term when making decisions that affected the environment and biodiversity. Unfortunately, our ancestors lacked the knowledge and technology to fully understand the potential consequences of their actions. Our descendants will likely wish that we had done more to prevent further damage to the environment and biodiversity. We have the knowledge and technology now to make better decisions and take action to mitigate climate change and protect biodiversity. Therefore, it is up to us to be responsible stewards of our planet and ensure a better future for generations to come.
