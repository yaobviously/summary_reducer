not to make them richthat we did for Achmet. You'll find the treasure where the key is,and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us,I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you thisjourney.""You are deceiving us, Small," said Athelney Jones, sternly. "If youhad wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have beeneasier for you to have thrown box and all.""Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover," he answered,with a shrewd, sidelong look. "The man that was clever enough to huntme down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of ariver. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be aharder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad whenyou came up with us. However, there's no good grieving over it. I'vehad ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cryover spilled milk.""This is a very serious matter, Small," said the detective. "If youhad helped justice,
instead of thwarting it in this way, you wouldhave had a better chance at your trial.""Justice!" snarled the ex-convict. "A pretty justice! Whose loot isthis, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give itup to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it!Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work underthe mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts,bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursedblack-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. Thatwas how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justicebecause I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only thatanother may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or haveone of Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell andfeel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money thatshould be mine." Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all thiscame out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes
blazed, and thehandcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of hishands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of theman, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which hadpossessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convictwas upon his track."You forget that we know nothing of all this," said Holmes quietly."We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice mayoriginally have been on your side.""Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can seethat I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists.Still, I bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. Ifyou want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I sayto you is God's truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put theglass beside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry."I am a Worcestershire man myself,--born near Pershore. I dare sayyou would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look.I
