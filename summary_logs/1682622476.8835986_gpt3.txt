inaction.At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck offeverish color upon either cheek."You are knocking yourself up, old man," I remarked. "I heard youmarching about in the night.""No, I could not sleep," he answered. "This infernal problem isconsuming me. It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle,when all else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch,everything; and yet I can get no news. I have set other agencies atwork, and used every means at my disposal. The whole river has beensearched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smithheard of her husband. I shall come to the conclusion soon that theyhave scuttled the craft. But there are objections to that.""Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.""No, I think that may be dismissed. I had inquiries made, and thereis a launch of that description.""Could it have gone up the river?""I have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-partywho will work up as far as
Richmond. If no news comes to-day, I shallstart off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat.But surely, surely, we shall hear something."We did not, however. Not a word came to us either from Wiggins orfrom the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papersupon the Norwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile tothe unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found,however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon thefollowing day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to reportour ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmesdejected and somewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions,and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis whichinvolved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors, ending atlast in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to thesmall hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of histest-tubes which told me that he was still
engaged in his malodorousexperiment.In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find himstanding by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with apea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his neck."I am off down the river, Watson," said he. "I have been turning itover in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worthtrying, at all events.""Surely I can come with you, then?" said I."No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as myrepresentative. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards thatsome message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondentabout it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, andto act on your own judgment if any news should come. Can I rely uponyou?""Most certainly.""I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I canhardly tell yet where I may find myself. If I am in luck, however, Imay not be gone so very long. I shall have news of some sort or otherbefore I get back."I had heard


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes is struggling to solve a problem and is frustrated by the lack of progress. He has exhausted all of his resources but still has not found any news. He decides to go down the river himself in search of answers, leaving his friend Watson behind to act on his own judgement if any news should come in while he is away. He is uncertain of when he will return, but hopes that he will have some kind of news by then.
