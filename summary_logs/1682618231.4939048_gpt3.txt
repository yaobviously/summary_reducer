PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is the idea that we should prioritize decisions and actions that will have the greatest positive impact on future generations. This means taking into account not only the short-term consequences of our decisions, but also their long-term effects. It is a way of thinking about how our current actions will shape the world for generations to come. The concept of longtermism has been around for centuries, but it has only recently gained traction in mainstream discourse. The idea is gaining momentum as people become increasingly aware of the need to take action to mitigate climate change and protect biodiversity. Longtermism encourages us to think beyond our own lifetimes and consider how our decisions today will affect future generations. It is important to remember that longtermism is not just about environmental issues; it applies to all aspects of life. We should consider the long-term implications of our economic, social, and political decisions, as well as those related to the environment. By doing so, we can ensure that our actions are beneficial for both present and future generations.
