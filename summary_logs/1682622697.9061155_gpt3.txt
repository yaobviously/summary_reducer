tohis shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the whole front ofhis skull in. You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him.We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance, but whenI got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I made for the boat,and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought all hisearthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among otherthings, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nutmatting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we werebeating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were pickedup by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargoof Malay pilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soonmanaged to settle down among them. They had one very good quality:they let you alone and asked no questions."Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chumand I went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you hereuntil the sun was shining. Here
and there we drifted about the world,something always turning up to keep us from London. All the time,however, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto atnight. A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last,however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England.I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set towork to discover whether he had realized the treasure, or if he stillhad it. I made friends with someone who could help me,--I name nonames, for I don't want to get any one else in a hole,--and I soonfound that he still had the jewels. Then I tried to get at him inmany ways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters,besides his sons and his khitmutgar, on guard over him."One day, however, I got word that he was dying. I hurried at once tothe garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that,and, looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with hissons on each side of him. I'd have
come through and taken my chancewith the three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped,and I knew that he was gone. I got into his room that same night,though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record ofwhere he had hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however: so Icame away, bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left Ibethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be asatisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred: so Iscrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on thechart, and I pinned it on his bosom. It was too much that he shouldbe taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he hadrobbed and befooled."We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairsand other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meatand dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after aday's work. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, andfor some years

==========

RESPONSE:

This is the story of a man and his companion, Tonga, who set out on a journey to find the treasure stolen from them by Sholto. After a ten day journey at sea, they are picked up by a trader and settle among the Malay pilgrims. They drift around the world for several years before finally returning to England and finding out that Sholto still had the jewels. The man eventually breaks into Sholto's room, but finds no record of where he had hidden the treasure. Before leaving, he pins a sign of their foursome onto Sholto's chest as a mark of their hatred. To make a living, the man and Tonga exhibit Tonga at fairs and other such places to earn money. The man also keeps up with news from Pondicherry Lodge.
