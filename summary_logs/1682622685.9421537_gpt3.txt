cool, careless way, but his eyes were shining with excitementand greed."'Why, as to that, gentlemen,' I answered, trying also to be cool,but feeling as excited as he did, 'there is only one bargain which aman in my position can make. I shall want you to help me to myfreedom, and to help my three companions to theirs.We shall thentake yo into partnership, and give you a fifth share to dividebetween you.'"'Hum!' said he. 'A fifth share! That is not very tempting.'"'It would come to fifty thousand apiece,' said I."'But how can we gain your freedom? You know very well that you askan impossibility.'"'Nothing of the sort,' I answered. 'I have thought it all out to thelast detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boatfit for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time.There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madraswhich would serve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shallengage to get aboard her by night, and if you will drop us on
anypart of the Indian coast you will have done your part of thebargain.'"'If there were only one,' he said."'None or all,' I answered. 'We have sworn it. The four of us mustalways act together.'"'You see, Morstan,' said he, 'Small is a man of his word. He doesnot flinch from his friend. I think we may very well trust him.'"'It's a dirty business,' the other answered. 'Yet, as you say, themoney would save our commissions handsomely.'"'Well, Small,' said the major, 'we must, I suppose, try and meetyou. We must first, of course, test the truth of your story.

'I must havethe consent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or nonewith us.'"'Nonsense!' he broke in. 'What have three black fellows to do withour agreement?'"'Black or blue,' said I, 'they are in with me, and we all
gotogether.'"Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh,Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present. We talked the matterover again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provideboth the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and markthe place in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was togo to India to test our story. If he found the box he was to leave itthere, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which wasto lie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, andfinally to return to his duties. Captain Morstan was then to applyfor leave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have afinal division of the treasure, he taking the major's share as wellas his own. All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mindcould think or the lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink,and by the morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with thesign of four,--that is, of Abdullah,
