comeround to all the posts, to make sure that all was well."The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small,driving rain. It was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour afterhour in such weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk,but without much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed,and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that mycompanions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe,and laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the twoSikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelledit at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat andswore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved astep."My first thought was that these fellows were in league with therebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our doorwere in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the womenand children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlementhink
that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you myword that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of theknife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving ascream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. Theman who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I bracedmyself to it, he whispered, 'Don't make a noise. The fort is safeenough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river.' There wasthe ring of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised myvoice I was a dead man. I could read it in the fellow's brown eyes. Iwaited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wantedfrom me."'Listen to me, Sahib,' said the taller and fiercer of the pair, theone whom they called Abdullah Khan. 'You must either be with us nowor you must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for usto hesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath onthe cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be
throwninto the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebelarmy. There is no middle way. Which is it to be, death or life? Wecan only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing,and all must be done before the rounds come again.'"'How can I decide?' said I. 'You have not told me what you want ofme. But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety ofthe fort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home yourknife and welcome.'"'It is nothing against the fort,' said he. 'We only ask you to dothat which your countrymen come to this land for. We ask you to berich. If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you uponthe naked knife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was everknown to break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot. Aquarter of the treasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.'"'But what is the treasure, then?' I asked. 'I am as ready to be richas you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.'"'You
