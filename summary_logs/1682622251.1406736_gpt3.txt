well to start atonce," I ventured to remark.He laughed until his ears were quite red. "That would hardly do," hecried. "I don't know what he would say if I brought you in thatsudden way. No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand toeach other. In the first place, I must tell you that there areseveral points in the story of which I am myself ignorant. I can onlylay the facts before you as far as I know them myself."My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once ofthe Indian army. He retired some eleven years ago, and came to liveat Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India, andbrought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collectionof valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With theseadvantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. Mytwin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children."I very well remember the sensation which was caused by thedisappearance of Captain Morstan. We read the
details in the papers,and, knowing that he had been a friend of our father's, we discussedthe case freely in his presence. He used to join in our speculationsas to what could have happened. Never for an instant did we suspectthat he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,--that of allmen he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan."We did know, however, that some mystery--some positivedanger--overhung our father.

What was inthe letter we could never discover, but I could see as he held itthat it was short and written in a scrawling hand. He had sufferedfor years from an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse,and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond allhope, and that he wished to make a last communication to us."When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows andbreathing heavily. He besought us to lock the door and to come uponeither side of the bed. Then, grasping our hands, he made aremarkable statement to us, in a voice which was broken as much byemotion as by pain.
