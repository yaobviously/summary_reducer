will swear, then,' said he, 'by the bones of your father, bythe honor of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise nohand and speak no word against us, either now or afterwards?'"'I will swear it,' I answered, 'provided that the fort is notendangered.'"'Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter ofthe treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.'"'There are but three,' said I."'No; Dost Akbar must have his share. We can tell the tale to youwhile we await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, andgive notice of their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tellit to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee,and that we may trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though youhad sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood wouldhave been upon the knife, and your body in the water. But the Sikhknows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken,then, to what I have to say."'There is a rajah
in the northern provinces who has much wealth,though his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, andmore still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature andhoards his gold rather than spend it. When the troubles broke out hewould be friends both with the lion and the tiger,--with the Sepoyand with the Company's raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that thewhite men's day was come, for through all the land he could hear ofnothing but of their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a carefulman, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of histreasure should be left to him. That which was in gold and silver hekept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stonesand the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sentit by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, shouldtake it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace.Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Companyconquered his
jewels would be saved to him. Having thus divided hishoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they werestrong upon his borders. By doing this, mark you, Sahib, his propertybecomes the due of those who have been true to their salt."'This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, isnow in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort.He has with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar,who knows his secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead himto a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for hispurpose. Here he will come presently, and here he will find MahometSingh and myself awaiting him. The place is lonely, and none shallknow of his coming. The world shall know of the merchant Achmet nomore, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us.What say you to it, Sahib?'"In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacredthing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Two Sikhs and a Feringhee, who is the narrator, are discussing a plan to steal a treasure belonging to a Rajah in the northern provinces. The Rajah had divided his hoard into gold, silver, and jewels and sent the jewels to the fort at Agra for safekeeping. The Sikhs have arranged for a merchant named Achmet, who is actually a trusted servant of the Rajah, to arrive at a side-postern of the fort with his companion, Dost Akbar, who knows the secret. The narrator is asked to swear an oath not to raise his hand or speak against them and agrees in exchange for a quarter of the treasure. The narrator reflects on the differences between life in Worcestershire and life in India where fire and blood are commonplace.
