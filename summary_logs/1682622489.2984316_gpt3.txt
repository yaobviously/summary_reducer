a loud peal at the bell,an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less aperson than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different washe, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sensewho had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. Hisexpression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic."Good-day, sir; good-day," said he. "Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, Iunderstand.""Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. But perhaps youwould care to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars.""Thank you; I don't mind if I do," said he, mopping his face with ared bandanna handkerchief."And a whiskey-and-soda?""Well, half a glass. It is very hot for the time of year; and I havehad a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about thisNorwood case?""I remember that you expressed one.""Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I had my net drawntightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in
themiddle of it. He was able to prove an alibi which could not beshaken. From the time that he left his brother's room he was neverout of sight of some one or other. So it could not be he who climbedover roofs and through trap-doors. It's a very dark case, and myprofessional credit is at stake. I should be very glad of a littleassistance.""We all need help sometimes," said I."Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir," said he,in a husky and confidential voice. "He's a man who is not to be beat.I have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I neversaw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon. He isirregular in his methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping attheories, but, on the whole, I think he would have made a mostpromising officer, and I don't care who knows it. I have had a wirefrom him this morning, by which I understand that he has got someclue to this Sholto business. Here is the message."He took the telegram out of his pocket, and
handed it to me. It wasdated from Poplar at twelve o'clock. "Go to Baker Street at once," itsaid. "If I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the trackof the Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to bein at the finish.""This sounds well. He has evidently picked up the scent again," saidI."Ah, then he has been at fault too," exclaimed Jones, with evidentsatisfaction. "Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes. Ofcourse this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as anofficer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some oneat the door. Perhaps this is he."A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing andrattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once ortwice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but atlast he made his way to our door and entered. His appearancecorresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man,clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to

RESPONSE:

Mr. Athelney Jones, an authoritative figure, arrives at the door of a person who is surprised by his presence. He is much different from his usual brusque and confident self, appearing meek and apologetic. He is there to ask for help in solving the Norwood case, as he has hit a dead end. He expresses admiration for Sherlock Holmes, who has sent him a telegram saying he is close to finding the culprits in the case. At that moment, a heavy-footed man appears at the door, wheezing and struggling for breath. He is an elderly man in seafaring clothes and an old pea-jacket.
