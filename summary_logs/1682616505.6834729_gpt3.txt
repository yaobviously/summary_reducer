PROMPT:

A better argument would be that the agency relationship (and habitual firing for inferior short-term performance), rather than capitalism, leads to excess short-termism. Capitalism has plenty of agency relationships, of course, but so do all other systems, including politics and the charitable sector. At least under capitalism there is an incentive to terminate or alter the most destructive agency relationships, precisely because they reduce longer-term wealth. As for the negative externalities of capitalism, for example in the form of carbon emissions, regulation is needed to solve those problems, not more patient behaviour in the markets; and in that sense the issue is not one of short- vs longtermism at all.
Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.

RESPONSE:

However, Zielonka's book does provide a valuable counterpoint to Fisher's long-termism. It is true that long-term thinking is essential if we are to tackle the global challenges we face. But it is also true that short-termism can be a powerful tool in the hands of those who seek to perpetuate the status quo. Zielonka's book provides a timely reminder that we must be aware of the dangers of short-termism, and that we must take action to ensure that our long-term goals are not undermined by short-term interests.
