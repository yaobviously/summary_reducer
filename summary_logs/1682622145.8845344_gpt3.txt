Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpieceand his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long,white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolledback his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes restedthoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarredwith innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp pointhome, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into thevelvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance,but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, fromday to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and myconscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lackedthe courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that Ishould deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in thecool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man withwhom one would care to
take anything approaching to a liberty. Hisgreat powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had hadof his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident andbackward in crossing him.Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had takenwith my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extremedeliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out nolonger."Which is it to-day?" I asked,--"morphine or cocaine?"He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume whichhe had opened. "It is cocaine," he said,--"a seven-per-cent solution.Would you care to try it?""No, indeed," I answered, brusquely. "My constitution has not gotover the Afghan campaign yet.

I find it,however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mindthat its secondary action is a
matter of small moment.""But consider!" I said, earnestly. "Count the cost! Your brain may,as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological andmorbid process, which involves increased tissue-change and may atlast leave a permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reactioncomes upon you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Whyshould you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those greatpowers with which you have been endowed?Remember that I speak notonly as one comrade to another, but as a medical man to one for whoseconstitution he is to some extent answerable."He did not seem offended. On the contrary, he put his fingertipstogether and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one whohas a relish for conversation."My mind," he said, "rebels at stagnation.

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes was preparing to inject himself with a seven-percent solution of cocaine. His friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, had been witnessing this ritual for some time, but had not had the courage to speak out against it. On this particular day, however, Watson could no longer contain his concerns and expressed his worries that the drug could have a negative effect on Holmes' health. Holmes listened to Watson's concerns and explained that he found the drug stimulating and clarifying to the mind and was not overly concerned with its potential side effects.
