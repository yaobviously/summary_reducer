think he foundout where the treasure was? He had come to the conclusion that it wassomewhere indoors: so he worked out all the cubic space of the house,and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should beunaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of thebuilding was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights ofall the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the spacebetween, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring thetotal to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccountedfor. These could only be at the top of the building. He knocked ahole, therefore, in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room,and there, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it,which had been sealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stoodthe treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it throughthe hole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels atnot less than half a million sterling."At the

Surely itwas the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I amashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that myheart turned as heavy as lead within me.

We had left the damp fog of the great city behindus, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from thewestward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half amoon peeping occasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough tosee for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of theside-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way.Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with avery high stone wall topped with broken glass.
