fierce eyes,and distorted features. Their feet and hands, however, are remarkablysmall. So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of theBritish official have failed to win them over in any degree. Theyhave always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining thesurvivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with theirpoisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by acannibal feast.' Nice, amiable people, Watson!
