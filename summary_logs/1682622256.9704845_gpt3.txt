Morstan's orphan. Thecursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life haswithheld from her the treasure, half at least of which should havebeen hers. And yet I have made no use of it myself,--so blind andfoolish a thing is avarice. The mere feeling of possession has beenso dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another. Seethat chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even thatI could not bear to part with, although I had got it out with thedesign of sending it to her. You, my sons, will give her a fair shareof the Agra treasure. But send her nothing--not even thechaplet--until I am gone. After all, men have been as bad as this andhave recovered."'I will tell you how Morstan died,' he continued. 'He had sufferedfor years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one. Ialone knew it. When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain ofcircumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. Ibrought it over to England, and on the night
of Morstan's arrival hecame straight over here to claim his share. He walked over from thestation, and was admitted by my faithful Lal Chowdar, who is nowdead. Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division ofthe treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out ofhis chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his handto his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards,cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest. When Istooped over him I found, to my horror, that he was dead."'For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do.My first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I couldnot but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accusedof his murder. His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash inhis head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry couldnot be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, whichI was particularly anxious to keep secret. He
had told me that nosoul upon earth knew where he had gone. There seemed to be nonecessity why any soul ever should know."'I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw myservant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. He stole in and bolted the doorbehind him. "Do not fear, Sahib," he said. "No one need know that youhave killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?" "I didnot kill him," said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. "Iheard it all, Sahib," said he. "I heard you quarrel, and I heard theblow. But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us puthim away together." That was enough to decide met. If my own servantcould not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it goodbefore twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box? Lal Chowdar and Idisposed of the body that night, and within a few days the Londonpapers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan.You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in thematter.
