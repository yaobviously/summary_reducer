follow him," he said, drawing on his stockings andboots. "Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry hehad dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors expressit."The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch wovenout of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it.In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside werehalf a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at theother, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto."They are hellish things," said he. "Look out that you don't prickyourself. I'm delighted to have them, for the chances are that theyare all he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one inour skin before long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself.Are you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?""Certainly," I answered."Your leg will stand it?""Oh, yes.""Here you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!" Hepushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose,
while thecreature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a mostcomical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet ofa famous vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance,fastened a stout cord to the mongrel's collar, and let him to thefoot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into asuccession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on theground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at apace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see somedistance in the cold gray light.

The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps andill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonizedwith the black
tragedy which hung over it.On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly,underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by ayoung beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had beenloosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon thelower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder.Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it overupon the other side."There's the print of wooden-leg's hand," he remarked, as I mountedup beside him. "You see the slight smudge of blood upon the whiteplaster. What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rainsince yesterday! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of theireight-and-twenty hours' start."I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the greattraffic which had passed along the London road in the interval.
