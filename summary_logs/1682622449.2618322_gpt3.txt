already been arrested, together with the housekeeper,Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, orgatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief orthieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones'swell-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observationhave enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could nothave entered by the door or by the window, but must have made theirway across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door intoa room which communicated with that in which the body was found. Thisfact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively thatit was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action ofthe officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence onsuch occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot butthink that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see ourdetectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and moreeffective
touch with the cases which it is their duty toinvestigate.""Isn't it gorgeous!" said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. "Whatdo you think of it?""I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrestedfor the crime.""So do I. I wouldn't answer for our safety now, if he should happento have another of his attacks of energy."At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hearMrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail ofexpostulation and dismay."By heaven, Holmes," I said, half rising, "I believe that they arereally after us.""No, it's not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force,--theBaker Street irregulars."As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon thestairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty andragged little street-Arabs. There was some show of discipline amongthem, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up inline and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number,taller
and older than the others, stood forward with an air oflounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputablelittle carecrow."Got your message, sir," said he, "and brought 'em on sharp. Threebob and a tanner for tickets.""Here you are," said Holmes, producing some silver. "In future theycan report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the houseinvaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should allhear the instructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steamlaunch called the Aurora, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two redstreaks, funnel black with a white band. She is down the riversomewhere. I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith's landing-stageopposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back. You must divide itout among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly. Let me know themoment you have news. Is that all clear?""Yes, guv'nor," said Wiggins."The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat.Here's a day in advance. Now off you go!"

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are on the case of a burglary, with the help of the police officers. They have arrested the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter or gatekeeper named McMurdo. Holmes is able to prove conclusively that the thieves must have entered through a trap door in the roof of the building. At that moment, a group of street-Arabs arrive at the door, sent by Holmes to search for a steam launch called the Aurora. He pays them and sends them off to search both banks of the river for the boat.
