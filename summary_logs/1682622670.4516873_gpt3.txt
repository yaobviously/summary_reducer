should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally amongourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems ofsuch value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there wasno privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. Wecarried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buriedthe body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall,we made a hollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of theplace, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and putthe sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that weshould each always act for all, so that none might take advantage.That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that Ihave never broken."Well, there's no use my telling you gentlemen what came of theIndian mutiny. After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknowthe back of the business was broken. Fresh troops came pouring in,and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A
flying columnunder Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandiesaway from it. Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and wefour were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we mightsafely go off with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however,our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers ofAchmet."It came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into thehands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man.They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does thisrajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him toplay the spy upon the first? This second man was ordered never to letAchmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He wentafter him that night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of coursehe thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admissionthere himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. Thisseemed to him so strange that he spoke about it
to a sergeant ofguides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. A thoroughsearch was quickly made, and the body was discovered. Thus at thevery moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seizedand brought to trial on a charge of murder,--three of us because wehad held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known tohave been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about thejewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed anddriven out of India: so no one had any particular interest in them.The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that wemust all have been concerned in it. The three Sikhs got penalservitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentencewas afterwards commuted into the same as the others."It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then.There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious littlechance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret whichmight have

RESPONSE:

Four men, including the narrator, are arrested for the murder of Achmet and are sentenced to life in prison. The four men had buried a box of jewels in a hall near the fort, which they had planned to divide among themselves. However, they were discovered when a second servant of the Rajah, who was sent to spy on Achmet, noticed his disappearance and reported it to the commandant. Despite their conviction, none of the four men revealed the secret of their treasure, and it remains buried in the hall.
