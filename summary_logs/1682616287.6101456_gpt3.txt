PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of considering the long-term consequences of our actions and decisions. It is based on the idea that our decisions today will have a lasting impact on future generations and that we should be mindful of this when making decisions. The philosophy also argues that we should prioritize interventions that have a lasting impact on future generations, such as those that reduce global warming or preserve biodiversity. In order to live by the implications of longtermism, we must be willing to make sacrifices in the present in order to ensure a better future. This could mean investing in renewable energy sources, reducing carbon emissions, or preserving natural habitats. We must also be willing to think beyond our own lifetimes and consider the consequences of our actions for future generations. By taking a longterm view, we can ensure that our decisions today will have positive effects for generations to come.
