The narrator is in a canoe on the river and is planning to hide on Jackson's Island. He hears a skiff with one man in it and realizes it is his father, so he quickly hides. He eventually makes it to the island and rests in the shade of the trees. He hears people talking at the ferry landing and soon after hears cannon fire as they are trying to find his body in the river. He decides to stay where he is and watches the smoke from the cannon fire. He then has an idea to use quicksilver-filled loaves of bread to help locate his body.
The narrator is on an island, trying to catch bread with a long stick. He is successful and finds a nice place to rest and eat the bread. He comes to the conclusion that there must be something to prayer when people like the widow or the parson pray. He then sets up camp in the woods and goes exploring, where he almost steps on a snake. He then finds a campfire that is still smoking, which scares him back to his camp. He spends three days and nights in his camp, exploring the island and catching fish to eat. On the fourth day, he hears horses coming and hides in his canoe. It turns out to be Pap, Judge Thatcher, Bessie Thatcher, Jo Harper, Tom Sawyer, his old Aunt Polly, Sid and Mary. They are searching for a corpse but eventually give up and go home. The narrator is relieved that nobody else is going to come looking for him and continues living on the island for some time.
