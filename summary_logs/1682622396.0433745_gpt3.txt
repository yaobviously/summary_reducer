the pungentsmell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents."Do not imagine," said Holmes, "that I depend for my success in thiscase upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his footin the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to tracethem in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and,since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if Ineglected it. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming thepretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised tobe. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but forthis too palpable clue.""There is credit, and to spare," said I. "I assure you, Holmes, thatI marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case,even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems tome to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could youdescribe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?""Pshaw, my dear boy! it was
simplicity itself. I don't wish to betheatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are incommand of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buriedtreasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named JonathanSmall. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in CaptainMorstan's possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and hisassociates,--the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically calledit. Aided by this chart, the officers--or one of them--gets thetreasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, somecondition under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why didnot Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious.The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into closeassociation with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasurebecause he and his associates were themselves convicts and could notget away.""But that is mere speculation," said I."It is more than that. It is the only hypothesis
which covers thefacts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholtoremains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of histreasure. Then he receives a letter from India which gives him agreat fright. What was that?""A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.""Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have knownwhat their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been asurprise to him. What does he do then? He guards himself against awooden-legged man,--a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a whitetradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only onewhite man's name is on the chart. The others are Hindoos orMohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say withconfidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with JonathanSmall. Does the reasoning strike yo as being faulty?""No: it is clear and concise.""Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Letus look at it from his point


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes explains to his friend Watson that he has knowledge which would allow him to trace a group of criminals who had knowledge of buried treasure. Holmes believes that one of the criminals, Jonathan Small, did not get the treasure because he and his associates were convicts and could not get away. Major Sholto is then frightened by a letter from India, which leads him to guard himself against a wooden-legged man. Holmes concludes that the wooden-legged man must be Jonathan Small, as he is the only white man on the chart. Holmes then hypothesizes what Jonathan Small's motivations might have been in not getting the treasure.
