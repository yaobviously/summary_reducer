without it. But a second consideration struck me.Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of hiscompanion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give riseto gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. Hewas quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from theirhead-quarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get backbefore it was broad light. Now, it was past three o'clock, accordingto Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. It would be quite bright, andpeople would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they didnot go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reservedhis launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings withthe treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to seewhat view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, theywould make their way under cover of darkness to some ship atGravesend or in the Downs, where no doubt they had already arrangedfor passages to
America or the Colonies.""But the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings.""Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, inspite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small,and looked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probablyconsider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf wouldmake pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How,then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand whenwanted? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. Icould only think of one way of doing it. I might land the launch overto some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a triflingchange in her. She would then be removed to his shed or hard, and sobe effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her ata few hours' notice.""That seems simple enough.""It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to beoverlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea.
I started atonce in this harmless seaman's rig and inquired at all the yards downthe river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at thesixteenth--Jacobson's--I learned that the Aurora had been handed overto them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivialdirections as to her rudder. 'There ain't naught amiss with herrudder,' said the foreman. 'There she lies, with the red streaks.' Atthat moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missingowner? He was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course,have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of hislaunch. 'I want her to-night at eight o'clock,' said he,--'eighto'clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won't be keptwaiting.' They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush ofmoney, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him somedistance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so I went back to theyard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, Istationed him as a sentry over


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes is trying to solve a Norwood tragedy and has deduced that the culprits, Jonathan Small and his companion, likely did not go far from their headquarters due to the time of night. He believes that they would have wanted to get back before it was light, so he reasons that they must have paid someone to keep quiet about their escape and hurried back to their lodgings with the treasure. He then comes up with a plan to find the launch they used, which is to find a boat-builder or repairer who they may have given the launch to with instructions to make a minor change. After visiting numerous yards, he finds the launch at Jacobson's and sees Mordecai Smith, the missing owner, who had been paid well by the culprits to have the launch ready at 8 o'clock sharp. Holmes then sends one of his boys as a sentry to watch the launch.
