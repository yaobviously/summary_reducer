there was no news to hear, except that they werehunting for the treasure. At last, however, came what we had waitedfor so long. The treasure had been found. It was up at the top of thehouse, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto's chemical laboratory. I came atonce and had a look at the place, but I could not see how with mywooden leg I was to make my way up to it. I learned, however, about atrap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto's supper-hour. Itseemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga. Ibrought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. Hecould climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof,but, as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in theroom, to his cost. Tonga thought he had done something very clever inkilling him, for when I came up by the rope I found him struttingabout as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I madeat him with the rope's end and cursed him for a little blood-thirstyimp. I took the
treasure-box and let it down, and then slid downmyself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, toshow that the jewels had come back at last to those who had mostright to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, andmade off the way that he had come."I don't know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard awaterman speak of the speed of Smith's launch, the Aurora, so Ithought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with oldSmith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship.He knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not inour secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you,gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,--for you have not done me a verygood turn,--but it is because I believe the best defence I can makeis just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly Ihave myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of thedeath of his son.""A very remarkable account," said
Sherlock Holmes. "A fitting wind-upto an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to mein the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought yourown rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga hadlost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.""He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipeat the time.""Ah, of course," said Holmes. "I had not thought of that.""Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?" askedthe convict, affably."I think not, thank you," my companion answered."Well, Holmes," said Athelney Jones, "You are a man to be humored,and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty isduty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friendasked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-tellerhere safe under lock and key. The cab still waits, and there are twoinspectors down-stairs. I am much obliged to you both for yourassistance. Of course you


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

The search for the treasure had been ongoing until finally it was found in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto's chemical laboratory. The protagonist, with the help of Tonga, was able to get the treasure box out of the room, leaving behind a sign of the four on the table. After this, they escaped using a launch called the Aurora and were eventually apprehended by the police. Sherlock Holmes concluded that the story was a fitting end to an interesting case and had no more questions for the convict. Athelney Jones thanked them for their assistance and took the convict away in a cab.
