fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only thebody, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to Morstan's shareas well as to my own. I wish you, therefore, to make restitution. Putyour ears down to my mouth. The treasure is hidden in--At thisinstant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes staredwildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can neverforget, 'Keep him out! For Christ's sake keep him out'! We bothstared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. Aface was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see thewhitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It wasa bearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression ofconcentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed towards the window,but the man was gone. When we returned to my father his head haddropped and his pulse had ceased to beat."We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of theintruder, save that just under the window a single
footmark wasvisible in the flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might havethought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face.We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that therewere secret agencies at work all round us. The window of my father'sroom was found open in the morning, his cupboards and boxes had beenrifled, and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with thewords 'The sign of the four' scrawled across it. What the phrasemeant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. As faras we can judge, none of my father's property had been actuallystolen, though everything had been turned out. My brother and Inaturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear whichhaunted my father during his life; but it is still a complete mysteryto us."The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfullyfor a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to hisextraordinary narrative. At the short account of her
father's deathMiss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared thatshe was about to faint. She rallied however, on drinking a glass ofwater which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe uponthe side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with anabstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glitteringeyes. As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very dayhe had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here atleast was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. Mr.Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obviouspride at the effect which his story had produced, and then continuedbetween the puffs of his overgrown pipe."My brother and I," said he, "were, as you may imagine, much excitedas to the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and formonths we dug and delved in every part of the garden, withoutdiscovering its whereabouts. It was maddening to think that thehiding-place was on

==========

RESPONSE:

Thaddeus Sholto recounts a mysterious incident that happened to his family when he and his brother were young. His father had been haunted by a fear and one night they saw a wild, fierce face looking in at their window. They searched the garden but found only one trace, a single footprint in the flower bed. The next morning they found the window of his father's room open, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his chest was a torn piece of paper with the words "The Sign of the Four" scrawled across it. What the phrase meant or who their secret visitor may have been remained a mystery. Thaddeus and his brother then searched for the treasure their father had mentioned but were unable to find it.
