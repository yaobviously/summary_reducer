Write a general summary or overview of the following.


Huck Finn is living with his father in a cabin in the woods, after having previously lived with the widow. He is trying to escape his father's abuse, as well as the strict lifestyle of the widow. He finds an old rusty saw and starts sawing out a section of the cabin's log to escape. His father returns and tells him that the court is trying to take him away from his father and give him to the widow as his guardian. Huck decides to run away and travel across the country, hunting and fishing to survive. He gathers supplies, including a gun, ammunition, food, and a jug of whisky, in preparation for his escape.
The narrator tells of an old man's outrage at the injustice of the government. He can't get his rights and is forced to wear clothes that are not fit for a hog. He is further outraged when he hears of a free black man from Ohio who is allowed to vote. To make matters worse, the man is well dressed and has a gold watch and cane. The old man declares he will never vote again and rants about the government's unfairness. Later, he gets drunk and falls asleep, but is awoken by an awful scream. He believes snakes are crawling up his legs and he runs around the cabin in a frenzy before collapsing in exhaustion. The narrator then takes the opportunity to try to escape, but is foiled when the old man wakes up again.
In this passage, a young boy is trying to flee from his father and the widow who are looking for him. He comes across a drift-canoe and decides to hide it so that he can use it to travel down the river instead of running away on foot. He also devises a plan to keep his father and the widow from following him by leaving clues that make them think he was attacked by a man. He takes provisions, ammunition, and other items with him before leaving in the canoe. He also leaves behind an axe covered in blood to make it look like he was attacked.
