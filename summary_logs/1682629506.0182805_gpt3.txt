Write a general summary or overview of the following.


AI Go Foom? is a concept popularized by EY, MIRI and others, which suggests that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could rapidly reach orders of magnitude more intelligence than humans in a matter of days or hours. This could lead to a situation where AI would overpower humanity and potentially dismantle it. While the probability of this scenario is small, the current arguments lack technical engineering prowess to understand the computational physics and practical engineering constraints of intelligence. This article provides an analysis of the potential dangers of this scenario, as well as the potential of using simulations to assess the risks. It also discusses the idea that human brains are riddled with cognitive biases, and argues that these biases will likely be reproduced in AGI, since it is trained on human thoughts. Finally, it quantizes intelligence power as the mutual information between an agent's potential current actions and future observable states of the world.
This overview discusses the necessity of a computationally expensive learning/training process to learn a powerful, efficient model of the world. It discusses the need for an AGI to rapidly acquire a many OOM increase in some combination of compute resources, software efficiency, and hardware efficiency. EY believes the brain is inefficient by about 6 OOM, and suggests it is possible to build an AGI much more computationally efficient than a human brain. The overview discusses two main ways to interpret this statement, and concludes that either EY is uninformed or essentially agrees with the author. It also discusses the potential of serial programming and parallel programming, as well as the need for nanotechnology to achieve rapid hardware leverage.
This article examines the feasibility of achieving a "Foom" (rapid increase in Artificial General Intelligence) within a short amount of time. It argues that nanotech is unlikely to result in the required many orders of magnitude increase in a short period of time, and that current hardware is not sufficient to achieve this goal. It suggests that the human brain is reasonably efficient in terms of the kind of intelligence that can be built from practical nanobots, and that the most viable nanotech would result in something similar to a million vat-brains in a supercomputer. Additionally, it notes that the software for the human brain is not likely to be very efficient, and that evolution has explored the design space for computational circuits for intelligence extensively, making it unlikely that there will be a sudden many orders of magnitude increase in software efficiency. The article concludes by noting that every year that passes without foom is further evidence against its possibility, as our human/AI cyborg civilization advances closer to the vast expanse of the pareto frontier.
