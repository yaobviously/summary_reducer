PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is the idea that we should prioritize decisions and actions based on their long-term consequences. It is a radical departure from the way we usually think about decision-making, which is typically focused on short-term results. Longtermism suggests that we should be willing to sacrifice short-term gains for the sake of long-term benefits, and that our decisions should be made with an eye towards the future. In the context of climate change and biodiversity, this means that we should be willing to make sacrifices now in order to ensure a better future for our descendants. This could include investing in renewable energy sources, reducing our consumption of fossil fuels, and protecting endangered species. It also means that we should be more mindful of the environmental impact of our decisions, and strive to make choices that will have positive long-term consequences. Ultimately, longtermism is a way of thinking about decision-making that puts future generations first. Our ancestors may not have been able to foresee the consequences of their decisions, but we can make sure that our descendants don’t suffer the same fate by making conscious choices that prioritize long-term sustainability.
