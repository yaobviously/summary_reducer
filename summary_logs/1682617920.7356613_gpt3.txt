PROMPT:

A better argument would be that the agency relationship (and habitual firing for inferior short-term performance), rather than capitalism, leads to excess short-termism. Capitalism has plenty of agency relationships, of course, but so do all other systems, including politics and the charitable sector. At least under capitalism there is an incentive to terminate or alter the most destructive agency relationships, precisely because they reduce longer-term wealth. As for the negative externalities of capitalism, for example in the form of carbon emissions, regulation is needed to solve those problems, not more patient behaviour in the markets; and in that sense the issue is not one of short- vs longtermism at all.
Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.

RESPONSE:

It is not clear how this would be practically achieved, and how it would bring about a more harmonious and sustainable world. A better argument would be that Zielonka's book provides a much needed practical approach to solving the global problems of today. Rather than relying on abstract philosophical arguments, Zielonka focuses on practical solutions that can be implemented in the short term. For example, his suggestion that we should move beyond the primacy of nation-states and empower local and transnational actors is a concrete step that could be taken to address global issues. This approach is much more realistic than relying on long-term philosophical solutions, which are often difficult to implement in the short term. Furthermore, Zielonka's approach is more inclusive, as it takes into account the needs and perspectives of different actors at a local, national and global level. This is an important step towards creating a more sustainable and harmonious world.
