allround you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn.Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as airto me, but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it, andI thought of what I might do in the old country with it, and how myfolk would stare when they saw their ne'er-do-well coming back withhis pockets full of gold moidores. I had, therefore, already made upmy mind. Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that I hesitated, pressedthe matter more closely."'Consider, Sahib,' said he, 'that if this man is taken by thecommandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by thegovernment, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now,since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well?The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company's coffers. Therewill be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. Noone can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men.What could be better for the
purpose?Say again, then, Sahib,whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.'"'I am with you heart and soul,' said I."'It is well,' he answered, handing me back my firelock. 'You seethat we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. Wehave now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.'"'Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?' I asked."'The plan is his. He has devised it. We will go to the gate andshare the watch with Mahomet Singh.'"The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginningof the wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky,and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay infront of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, andit could easily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing therewith those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming tohis death."Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the otherside of the moat. It vanished
among the mound-heaps, and thenappeared again coming slowly in our direction."'Here they are!' I exclaimed."'You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,' whispered Abdullah. 'Givehim no cause for fear. Send us in with him, and we shall do the restwhile you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, thatwe may be sure that it is indeed the man.'"The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing,until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. Ilet them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, andclimb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them."'Who goes there?' said I, in a subdued voice."'Friends,' came the answer. I uncovered my lantern and threw a floodof light upon them. The first was an enormous Sikh, with a blackbeard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund. Outside of a show Ihave never seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, roundfellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done upin a
