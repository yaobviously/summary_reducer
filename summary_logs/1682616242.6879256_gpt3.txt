PROMPT:

A better argument would be that the agency relationship (and habitual firing for inferior short-term performance), rather than capitalism, leads to excess short-termism. Capitalism has plenty of agency relationships, of course, but so do all other systems, including politics and the charitable sector. At least under capitalism there is an incentive to terminate or alter the most destructive agency relationships, precisely because they reduce longer-term wealth. As for the negative externalities of capitalism, for example in the form of carbon emissions, regulation is needed to solve those problems, not more patient behaviour in the markets; and in that sense the issue is not one of short- vs longtermism at all.
Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.

RESPONSE:

A better argument would be that the current system of global governance, which is largely based on the nation-state, is inadequate to address the global challenges of our time. The nation-state is often too slow and too limited in its scope to effectively address issues such as climate change, energy shortages and financial crises. Therefore, a more effective system of global governance is needed that can transcend traditional nation-state boundaries and empower other public actors at the local and transnational level. This could include supranational institutions, such as the United Nations or the European Union, as well as non-state actors such as NGOs, international corporations and civil society organizations. Such a system could be better equipped to address global challenges through collective action and cooperation, rather than relying on individual nation-states to take action in isolation.
