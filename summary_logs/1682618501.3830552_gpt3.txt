PROMPT:

Entering this rapidly growing fray are three new books, each adding to the debate without coming close to concluding it. In The Long View: Why we need to transform how the world sees time, the science and technology journalist Richard Fisher tries to move us away from short-termism. He laments our environmental neglect, the two-year electoral cycles that define US congressional terms and managers who prioritize quarterly earnings reports. He admires the medieval cathedral constructed over centuries, and his perspective draws on the time scales of geology, his topic of study at university. Over time, including from the many interviews he has conducted for the BBC, he has come to believe that it is possible to teach humanity a longer-term perspective, and he weaves together history, science and philosophy in explaining how.
Fisher sees longtermism as a true innovation in social and philosophical thinking. Various churches have promoted long-term views, seen, for example, in the rituals of monks copying manuscripts, but until recently it was assumed that our secular world was predominantly short-term in outlook. And often it was. This has changed with the rise of environmentalism and, more generally, with the accumulation of varying disciplinary perspectives, many of which point our attention to a “long view” of time. The Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit (1942–2017) laid out these themes in his pioneering book Reasons and Persons (1984), which obsessed over the meaning of time for our understanding of the human self and furthermore argued that policy-makers should not discount the future merely because of its temporal distance. The Long View is sprawling in its coverage, but clear throughout, and offers a compelling vision of how so many strands of human thought have come together to support long-term perspectives.
One mistake that Fisher makes, also found in Jan Zielonka’s The Lost Future: And how to reclaim it, is to portray capitalism as a congenitally short-sighted economic system. One of Fisher’s chapters is titled “Selling Short: The unforgiving immediacy of capitalism”. But while there are numerous instances of impatient consumers, as well as portfolio managers who follow the investing herd to avoid losing their jobs, capitalism is by no means as short-sighted as Fisher’s and Zielonka’s rhetoric suggests. For example, adjusting for inflation, it is common for government securities to earn less than 1 per cent return per annum, one measure of market discount rates when long-term risk is taken away. Or consider the investors who put resources into companies with no revenue, or who support nuclear fusion, artificial intelligence or the construction of the metaverse. They are hardly in it for a quick killing. Precisely because investment returns compound, capitalism over time puts more resources into the hands of the more patient individuals. Most of all, a longtermist should want well-defined property rights to ease this process of capturing benefits today from good outcomes tomorrow. If you own the forest, you probably won’t chop down all the trees.
A better argument would be that the agency relationship (and habitual firing for inferior short-term performance), rather than capitalism, leads to excess short-termism. Capitalism has plenty of agency relationships, of course, but so do all other systems, including politics and the charitable sector. At least under capitalism there is an incentive to terminate or alter the most destructive agency relationships, precisely because they reduce longer-term wealth. As for the negative externalities of capitalism, for example in the form of carbon emissions, regulation is needed to solve those problems, not more patient behaviour in the markets; and in that sense the issue is not one of short- vs longtermism at all.
Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.
But are the transnational organizations in our current world so far-sighted? Have not most of them collapsed or weakened greatly in recent years, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization? What exactly is supposed to protect these organizations from a more general and rampant short-sightedness? (They are, by the way, full of agency relationships as criticized above.) Furthermore, since most electorates are locally or nationally defined, it is hard to resist the suspicion that transnational institutions will be far from democratic. The European Union, for all its virtues and successes, does not escape this charge.

RESPONSE:

In the end, longtermism is an admirable goal, but the books reviewed here do not offer a clear path to achieving it. They are valuable in that they draw attention to the importance of time, and the need to consider the future in our decisions today. But that is only a start. To move beyond short-termism will require a more nuanced understanding of the incentives and relationships that drive our behaviour, and a willingness to take risks in order to secure long-term gains.
