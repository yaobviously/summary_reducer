PROMPT:

Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.
But are the transnational organizations in our current world so far-sighted? Have not most of them collapsed or weakened greatly in recent years, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization? What exactly is supposed to protect these organizations from a more general and rampant short-sightedness? (They are, by the way, full of agency relationships as criticized above.) Furthermore, since most electorates are locally or nationally defined, it is hard to resist the suspicion that transnational institutions will be far from democratic. The European Union, for all its virtues and successes, does not escape this charge.

RESPONSE:

Zielonka's book does not provide a comprehensive answer to these questions, but it does offer some insight into the potential of transnational organizations to address global issues. He argues that the current system of nation-states is outdated and needs to be replaced by more decentralized and inclusive forms of governance. He proposes a range of measures to strengthen transnational organizations, such as the creation of a global parliament, the establishment of a global court system, and the adoption of global standards for human rights and environmental protection. He also suggests that global economic policy should be coordinated through a new global economic forum. Ultimately, Zielonka's book provides an interesting and thought-provoking vision of how transnational organizations can help address global challenges. It is not a blueprint for success, but rather an exploration of potential solutions that can help us move towards a more just and equitable world.
