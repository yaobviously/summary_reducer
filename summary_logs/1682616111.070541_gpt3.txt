Entering this rapidly growing fray are three new books, each adding to the debate without coming close to concluding it. In The Long View: Why we need to transform how the world sees time, the science and technology journalist Richard Fisher tries to move us away from short-termism. He laments our environmental neglect, the two-year electoral cycles that define US congressional terms and managers who prioritize quarterly earnings reports. He admires the medieval cathedral constructed over centuries, and his perspective draws on the time scales of geology, his topic of study at university. Over time, including from the many interviews he has conducted for the BBC, he has come to believe that it is possible to teach humanity a longer-term perspective, and he weaves together history, science and philosophy in explaining how.
Fisher sees longtermism as a true innovation in social and philosophical thinking. Various churches have promoted long-term views, seen, for example, in the rituals of monks copying manuscripts, but until recently it was assumed that our secular world was predominantly short-term in outlook. And often it was. This has changed with the rise of environmentalism and, more generally, with the accumulation of varying disciplinary perspectives, many of which point our attention to a “long view” of time. The Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit (1942–2017) laid out these themes in his pioneering book Reasons and Persons (1984), which obsessed over the meaning of time for our understanding of the human self and furthermore argued that policy-makers should not discount the future merely because of its temporal distance. The Long View is sprawling in its coverage, but clear throughout, and offers a compelling vision of how so many strands of human thought have come together to support long-term perspectives.
