bungalows, andday after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through ourestate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, wherewere the nearest troops. Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man. He hadit in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that itwould blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on hisveranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while thecountry was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I andDawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and themanaging. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on adistant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, whenmy eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of asteep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struckthrough my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut intoribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little furtherup the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with
anempty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other infront of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I shouldturn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up fromAbelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through theroof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would onlythrow my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I stoodI could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats stillon their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some ofthem pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so Ibroke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at nightsafe within the walls at Agra."As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. Thewhole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English couldcollect in little bands they held just the ground that their gunscommanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was afight of the millions against the
hundreds; and the cruellest part ofit was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, andgunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained,handling our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agrathere were the 3d Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse,and a battery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchantshad been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went outto meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them backfor a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon thecity. Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,--whichis not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will seethat we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better thana hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south.From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture andmurder and outrage."The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fiercedevil-


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man who refused to believe that the situation had been exaggerated and would blow over, despite the country being in a blaze. One day, the crash came when Dawson's wife was found dead and Dawson himself was found dead with four Sepoys in front of him. Smoke was seen coming from Abelwhite's bungalow, and it was burning. All across the country, English people were helpless fugitives and fighting against their own troops whom they had taught and trained. In Agra, a volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed and they went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge, but their powder gave out. Lucknow and Cawnpore were far away, and all around there was nothing but torture, murder, and outrage.
