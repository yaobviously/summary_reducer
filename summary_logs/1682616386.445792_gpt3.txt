PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is now the focus of a growing body of research and advocacy, and increasingly recognised as a moral imperative. The simple answer to the questions posed is yes. Our ancestors should have been more mindful of the long-term consequences of their decisions, and we should be doing the same. We know now that human activities have had a profound effect on our climate and environment, and that these effects will have long-lasting consequences for generations to come. It is our responsibility to ensure that we take steps to mitigate these effects, so that our descendants can enjoy a healthy and sustainable future.
