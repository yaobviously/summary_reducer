she?" he said, languidly. "I did not observe.""You really are an automaton,--a calculating-machine!" I cried."There is something positively inhuman in you at times."He smiled gently. "It is of the first importance," he said, "not toallow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client isto me a mere unit,--a factor in a problem. The emotional qualitiesare antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the mostwinning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three littlechildren for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of myacquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of amillion upon the London poor.""In this case, however--""I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have youever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you makeof this fellow's scribble?""It is legible and regular," I answered. "A man of business habitsand some force of character."Holmes shook his head. "Look at his long letters," he said.

He was bright, eager,and in excellent spirits,--a mood which in his case alternated withfits of the blackest depression."There is no great mystery in this matter," he said, taking the cupof tea which I had poured out for him. "The facts appear to admit ofonly one explanation.""What! you have solved it already?""Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestivefact, that is all.
