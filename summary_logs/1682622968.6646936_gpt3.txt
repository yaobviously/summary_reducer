They then visit a small brick house on the edge of the wharf belonging to Mordecai Smith, where they learn that a wooden-legged man with an ugly face had taken the launch. Holmes and Watson then cross the river in a wherry and discuss their plan of action. In order to avoid alerting the runaways that they are being pursued, Holmes suggests they take a hansom cab home, have breakfast, and get some sleep before possibly going out at night.

In order to find out more about the other man involved in the case, Holmes looks up information in a gazetteer and discovers that the aborigines of the Andaman Islands are known for being the smallest race on earth and for having large, misshapen heads and small, fierce personalities.
