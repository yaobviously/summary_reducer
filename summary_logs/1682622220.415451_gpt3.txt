Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the
muddy streets. Downthe Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light whichthrew a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellowglare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporousair, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowdedthoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-likein the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrowbars of light,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry.

GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

On a dreary September evening, Miss Morstan and two companions meet a small, dark, brisk man at the Lyceum Theatre. They are taken in a four-wheeler to their rendezvous, and the man inquires if either of the companions is a police-officer. Miss Morstan assures him they are not, and the man leads them away. Throughout their journey, Sherlock Holmes remains silent and contemplative, jotting down figures in his notebook by the light of his pocket-lantern. The streets are crowded with people of all kinds, and the yellow shop-window light casts a murky radiance across the thoroughfare.
