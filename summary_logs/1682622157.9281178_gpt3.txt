acknowledging my assistance." Hetossed over, as he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. Iglanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration,with stray magnifiques, coup-de-matres and tours-de-force, alltestifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman."He speaks as a pupil to his master," said I."Oh, he rates my assistance too highly," said Sherlock Holmes,lightly. "He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out ofthe three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has thepower of observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting inknowledge; and that may come in time. He is now translating my smallworks into French.""Your works?""Oh, didn't you know?" he cried, laughing. "Yes, I have been guiltyof several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here,for example, is one 'Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of theVarious Tobaccoes.' In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms ofcigar-, cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with
colored platesillustrating the difference in the ash. It is a point which iscontinually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes ofsupreme importance as a clue. If you can say definitely, for example,that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indianlunkah, it obviously narrows your field of search. To the trained eyethere is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopolyand the white fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and apotato.""You have an extraordinary genius for minutiae," I remarked."I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracingof footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris asa preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work uponthe influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypesof the hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers,and diamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interestto the scientific detective,--especially in
cases of unclaimedbodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I wearyyou with my hobby.""Not at all," I answered, earnestly. "It is of the greatest interestto me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing yourpractical application of it. But you spoke just now of observationand deduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.""Why, hardly," he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his armchair,and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. "For example,observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore StreetPost-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when thereyou dispatched a telegram.""Right!" said I. "Right on both points! But I confess that I don'tsee how you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, andI have mentioned it to no one.""It is simplicity itself," he remarked, chuckling at mysurprise,--"so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous;and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes is discussing his monographs on technical subjects, such as the distinction between the ashes of various tobaccos, the tracing of footsteps, and the influence of trade on the form of the hand. He explains that observation and deduction are two qualities necessary for the ideal detective, and he demonstrates this by correctly deducing that the narrator had sent a telegram from the Wigmore Street Post-Office that morning. He explains that while observation shows what has happened, deduction allows one to infer what has not been seen.
