Just opposite the Seymour Street Office theyhave taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies insuch a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering.The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far asI know, nowhere else in the neighborhood. So much is observation. Therest is deduction.""How, then, did you deduce the telegram?""Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I satopposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there thatyou have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of postcards.Whatcould you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire?Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be thetruth.""In this case it certainly is so," I replied, after a little thought."The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest.Would youthink me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a
