togiving directions."We all followed him into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon theleft-hand side of the passage. The old woman was pacing up and downwith a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight ofMiss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her."God bless your sweet calm face!" she cried, with an hysterical sob."It does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried thisday!"Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some fewwords of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into theothers bloodless cheeks."Master has locked himself in and will now answer me," she explained."All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to bealone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I wentup and peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr.Thaddeus,--you must go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr.Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but Inever saw him with such a face on

The key beingturned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmesbent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking ofthe breath."There is something devilish in this, Watson," said he, more movedthan I had ever before seen him. "What do you make of it?"I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight wasstreaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shiftyradiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in theair, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face,--the very faceof our companion Thaddeus.
