PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

Yes, our ancestors should have cared more about the long-term impacts of their decisions. By not doing so, they have left us with a legacy of environmental damage and species loss that will take generations to undo. It is now up to us to make sure that we are making decisions that are in the best interest of our descendants, and to ensure that we are not creating further problems for them to deal with. We must start thinking about the consequences of our actions, and how they will affect future generations. The effective altruism movement is a great example of how people are beginning to think more deeply about the implications of their actions for future generations, and how we can all take responsibility for our actions.
