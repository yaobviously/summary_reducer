the thoughtthat we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something ofHolmes's gaiety. None of us alluded during dinner to the cause whichhad brought us together.When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at this watch, and filledup three glasses with port. "One bumper," said he, "to the success ofour little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have youa pistol, Watson?""I have my old service-revolver in my desk.""You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see thatthe cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six."It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf,and found our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically."Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?""Yes,--that green lamp at the side.""Then take it off."The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes werecast off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man atthe rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-
inspectorsforward."Where to?" asked Jones."To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson's Yard."Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long linesof loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled withsatisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us."We ought to be able to catch anything on the river," he said."Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.""We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has a name for being aclipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect howannoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?""Yes.""Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemicalanalysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change ofwork is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolvingthe hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem ofthe Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had beenup the river and down the river without
result. The launch was not atany landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardlyhave been scuttled to hide their traces,--though that always remainedas a possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Smallhad a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capableof anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually aproduct of higher education. I then reflected that since he hadcertainly been in London some time--as we had evidence that hemaintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge--he could hardlyleave at a moment's notice, but would need some little time, if itwere only a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the balance ofprobability, at any rate.""It seems to me to be a little weak," said I. "It is more probablethat he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon hisexpedition.""No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable aretreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure thathe could do


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and Inspector Jones take a launch down the river in pursuit of the criminal Small. Holmes had been frustrated in his attempts to find Small and had taken a break from the case by doing a chemical analysis. He then returned to the case and figured out that Small was likely still in London and would need some time to arrange his affairs before leaving. They eventually catch up to the Aurora, a clipper launch, but it is unclear if they will be able to apprehend Small.
