Emmeline was known for her skill in writing poetry, which she often did about people who had died. The Grangerford family is described as being of the highest aristocracy in the town, and Col. Grangerford is described as a gentleman all over. He had a darkish-pale complexion, black eyes and black hair, and was always well-dressed. Everyone in the family was always well-mannered, and Col. Grangerford had a presence that made people feel confident and at ease.

When they got home, the old gentleman scolded Buck for shooting from behind a bush. Buck explained that it was because of the feud. He also explained what a feud was, how it started, how many people had been killed, and how it continued to this day. Everyone went to church together on Sunday, carrying their guns with them in case of any trouble.
