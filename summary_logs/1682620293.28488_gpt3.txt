Write a general summary of the following:


Entering this rapidly growing fray are three new books, each adding to the debate without coming close to concluding it. In The Long View: Why we need to transform how the world sees time, the science and technology journalist Richard Fisher tries to move us away from short-termism. He laments our environmental neglect, the two-year electoral cycles that define US congressional terms and managers who prioritize quarterly earnings reports. He admires the medieval cathedral constructed over centuries, and his perspective draws on the time scales of geology, his topic of study at university. Over time, including from the many interviews he has conducted for the BBC, he has come to believe that it is possible to teach humanity a longer-term perspective, and he weaves together history, science and philosophy in explaining how.
Fisher sees longtermism as a true innovation in social and philosophical thinking. Various churches have promoted long-term views, seen, for example, in the rituals of monks copying manuscripts, but until recently it was assumed that our secular world was predominantly short-term in outlook. And often it was. This has changed with the rise of environmentalism and, more generally, with the accumulation of varying disciplinary perspectives, many of which point our attention to a long view of time. The Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit (19422017) laid out these themes in his pioneering book Reasons and Persons (1984), which obsessed over the meaning of time for our understanding of the human self and furthermore argued that policy-makers should not discount the future merely because of its temporal distance. The Long View is sprawling in its coverage, but clear throughout, and offers a compelling vision of how so many strands of human thought have come together to support long-term perspectives.
One mistake that Fisher makes, also found in Jan Zielonkas The Lost Future: And how to reclaim it, is to portray capitalism as a congenitally short-sighted economic system. One of Fishers chapters is titled Selling Short: The unforgiving immediacy of capitalism. But while there are numerous instances of impatient consumers, as well as portfolio managers who follow the investing herd to avoid losing their jobs, capitalism is by no means as short-sighted as Fishers and Zielonkas rhetoric suggests. For example, adjusting for inflation, it is common for government securities to earn less than 1 per cent return per annum, one measure of market discount rates when long-term risk is taken away. Or consider the investors who put resources into companies with no revenue, or who support nuclear fusion, artificial intelligence or the construction of the metaverse. They are hardly in it for a quick killing. Precisely because investment returns compound, capitalism over time puts more resources into the hands of the more patient individuals. Most of all, a longtermist should want well-defined property rights to ease this process of capturing benefits today from good outcomes tomorrow. If you own the forest, you probably wont chop down all the trees.


GENERAL SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The debate over short-termism vs long-termism is growing, and three new books are adding to it. Richard Fisher's The Long View: Why We Need to Transform How the World Sees Time examines how long-term perspectives can be taught to humanity and draws on history, science, and philosophy to explain how. Derek Parfit's Reasons and Persons (1984) argued that policy makers should not discount the future due to its temporal distance. Jan Zielonka's The Lost Future: And How to Reclaim It portrays capitalism as a short-sighted economic system. However, capitalism is not as short-sighted as the rhetoric suggests, as investors often support long-term projects and well-defined property rights can ease the process of capturing benefits today from good outcomes tomorrow.
