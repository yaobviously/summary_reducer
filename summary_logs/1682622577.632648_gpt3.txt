Holmes, you must confess that you cutit rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.""All is well that ends well," said Holmes. "But I certainly did notknow that the Aurora was such a clipper.""Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and thatif he had had another man to help him with the engines we shouldnever have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwoodbusiness.""Neither he did," cried our prisoner,--"not a word. I chose hislaunch because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, butwe paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reachedour vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for theBrazils.""Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes tohim. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quickin condemning them." It was amusing to notice how the consequentialJones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength ofthe capture. From the slight smile which played over
SherlockHolmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost uponhim."We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently," said Jones, "and shallland you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell youthat I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doingthis. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is anagreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspectorwith you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, nodoubt?""Yes, I shall drive.""It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first.You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?""At the bottom of the river," said Small, shortly."Hum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We havehad work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warnyou to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Streetrooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station."They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a
bluff,genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour's drivebrought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servant seemed surprised atso late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, sheexplained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was inthe drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leavingthe obliging inspector in the cab.She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of whitediaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck andwaist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leanedback in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, andtinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxurianthair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, andher whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At thesound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a brightflush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks."I heard a cab drive up," she
