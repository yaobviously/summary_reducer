I answered."Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here wholowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securingone end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if youwere an active man, you might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You woulddepart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw upthe rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on theinside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minorpoint it may be noted," he continued, fingering the rope, "that ourwooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professionalsailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more thanone blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which Igather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skinoff his hand.""This is all very well," said I, "but the thing becomes moreunintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came heinto the room?""Yes, the ally!" repeated
Holmes, pensively. "There are features ofinterest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of thecommonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annalsof crime in this country,--though parallel cases suggest themselvesfrom India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.""How came he, then?" I reiterated. "The door is locked, the window isinaccessible. Was it through the chimney?""The grate is much too small," he answered. "I had already consideredthat possibility.""How then?"

We know thathe did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We alsoknow that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there isno concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?""He came through the hole in the roof," I cried."Of course he did. He must have done
so. If you will have thekindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researchesto the room above,--the secret room in which the treasure was found."He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, heswung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reacheddown for the lamp and held it while I followed him.The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one wayand six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thinlath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step frombeam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the innershell of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of anysort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor."Here you are, you see," said Sherlock Holmes, putting his handagainst the sloping wall. "This is a trap-door which leads out on tothe roof. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, slopingat a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which Number


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and his companion have come to a room with no apparent way out. Holmes suggests that they use a rope to climb out of the window, and explains that the previous inhabitant of the room must have had an ally to help him escape. He then discovers a trapdoor that leads to the roof, which is the way the previous inhabitant must have escaped. Holmes and his companion then explore the secret room in which the treasure was found.
