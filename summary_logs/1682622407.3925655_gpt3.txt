GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

In this narrative, Jonathan Small is a convict from the Andaman Islands who has come to England to reclaim his rights and exact revenge on the man who wronged him. He is unable to find out where the treasure is hidden, as only the major and one dead servant knew. When he finds out that the major is on his deathbed, he runs the gauntlet of guards to reach the window, but is stopped by the presence of two sons. In a frenzy, he enters the room that night, searches for a memo relating to the treasure, and leaves an inscription on a card. He had planned that should he kill the major he would leave a record as an act of justice. Small continues to keep a secret watch on efforts to find the treasure and eventually discovers the garret. He takes an associate with him who gets over the difficulty and leaves Toby with a six-mile limp. The associate commits the crime and Jonathan leaves his record and follows the treasure-box out. He is described as middle-aged, sunburned, bearded, and hairy.
