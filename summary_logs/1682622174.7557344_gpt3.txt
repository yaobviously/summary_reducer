remember right, been dead many years.It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.""Right, so far," said I. "Anything else?""He was a man of untidy habits,--very untidy and careless. He wasleft with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived forsome time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity,and finally, taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather."I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room withconsiderable bitterness in my heart."This is unworthy of you, Holmes," I said. "I could not have believedthat you would have descended to this. You have made inquires intothe history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce thisknowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe thatyou have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and, tospeak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.""My dear doctor," said he, kindly, "pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had
forgotten howpersonal and painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you,however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until youhanded me the watch.""Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get thesefacts? They are absolutely correct in every particular.""Ah, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance ofprobability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.""But it was not mere guess-work?""No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit,--destructive to thelogical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you donot follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon whichlarge inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating thatyour brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of thatwatch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, butit is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hardobjects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is nogreat feat to assume that a man
who treats a fifty-guinea watch socavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetchedinference that a man who inherits one article of such value is prettywell provided for in other respects."I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning."It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take awatch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon theinside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is norisk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less thanfour such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case.Inference,--that your brother was often at low water. Secondaryinference,--that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he couldnot have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the innerplate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands ofscratches all round the hole,--marks where the key has slipped. Whatsober man's key could have scored those grooves? But you will neversee a drunkard's


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

In this passage, Holmes is able to deduce information about the owner of a fifty-guinea watch by examining the watch itself. He is able to infer that the owner was careless and often at low water due to the dents and scratches on the watch case, as well as the number of pawnbroker tickets visible inside. He also infers that the owner had occasional bursts of prosperity due to the fact that he was able to redeem the pledge. Finally, he points out that the keyhole is covered with scratches, indicating that it was probably used by a drunkard.
