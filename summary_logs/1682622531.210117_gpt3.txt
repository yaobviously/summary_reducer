the launch. He is to stand at water'sedge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shall belying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do nottake men, treasure, and all.""You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right menor not," said Jones; "but if the affair were in my hands I shouldhave had a body of police in Jacobson's Yard, and arrested them whenthey came down.""Which would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewdfellow. He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made himsuspicious lie snug for another week.""But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to theirhiding-place," said I."In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is ahundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as hehas liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions? They send himmessages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, andthis is the best."While this conversation had been proceeding, we
had been shooting thelong series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the Citythe last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit ofSt. Paul's. It was twilight before we reached the Tower."That is Jacobson's Yard," said Holmes, pointing to a bristle ofmasts and rigging on the Surrey side. "Cruise gently up and down hereunder cover of this string of lighters." He took a pair ofnight-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. "Isee my sentry at his post," he remarked, "but no sign of ahandkerchief.""Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,"said Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even thepolicemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was goingforward."We have no right to take anything for granted," Holmes answered. "Itis certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot becertain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, andthey can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty

You would not think it, to lookat them. There is no a priori probability about it. A strange enigmais man!""Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal," I suggested."Winwood Reade is good upon the subject," said Holmes. "He remarksthat, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in theaggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example,never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say withprecision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, butpercentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see ahandkerchief? Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.""Yes, it is your boy," I cried. "I can see him plainly.""And there is the Aurora," exclaimed Holmes, "and going like thedevil! Full speed ahead,


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and his companions are on a boat in the Thames river, waiting for the launch of a group of criminals they are trying to apprehend. They have a plan to capture them, but Holmes is aware that the criminals may be too shrewd to be caught. As they pass by the City, the sun sets and they reach Jacobson's Yard where the criminals are expected. Holmes spots his sentry at his post and decides to wait for them to come down the river. He theorizes that even if they had stuck to Mordecai Smith, it would have been unlikely that Smith knew where they were hiding. As they wait, Holmes muses on the enigma of man and then spots a handkerchief in the distance, which reveals that their plan is working. Finally, they spot the Aurora, the boat carrying the criminals, speeding away.
