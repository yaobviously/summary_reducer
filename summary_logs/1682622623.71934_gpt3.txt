worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost amongthe narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river,therefore, and took up his position in the old fort at Agra. I don'tknow if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of thatold fort. It is a very queer place,--the queerest that ever I was in,and I have been in some rum corners, too. First of all, it isenormous in size. I should think that the enclosure must be acres andacres. There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women,children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. Butthe modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, wherenobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and thecentipedes. It is all full of great deserted halls, and windingpassages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easyenough for folk to get lost in it. For this reason it was seldom thatany one went into it, though now and again a party with torches mightgo
exploring."The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protectsit, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these hadto be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that whichwas actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardlymen enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns.It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard atevery one of the innumerable gates. What we did was to organize acentral guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gateunder the charge of one white man and two or three natives. I wasselected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a smallisolated door upon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikhtroopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed ifanything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon helpcoming at once from the central guard. As the guard was a good twohundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up
intoa labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as towhether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of anactual attack."Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me,since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For twonights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall,fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, bothold fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah.They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out ofthem. They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in theirqueer Sikh lingo. For myself, I used to stand outside the gate-way,looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lightsof the great city. The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, andthe yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang,were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbors acrossthe stream. Every two hours the officer of the night used to

==========

RESPONSE:

A small group of men were stationed in the old fort at Agra, which was enormous in size and full of winding passages and deserted halls. Due to being short-handed, a central guard-house was established, with one white man and two or three natives placed in charge of each gate. The protagonist was selected to take charge of a small isolated door on the southwest side of the building, with two Sikhs placed under his command. For two nights he kept watch with his Punjaubees, looking down on the river and the twinkling lights of the city, while hearing drums, tomtoms, and howls from the rebels across the river. Every two hours the officer of the night would check on their progress.
