Jim and Huck are on an island in the river and have found a good place to build a fire and cook their dinner. They set up a makeshift camp and soon a summer storm begins to brew. The storm gets so intense that the trees look like spider webs and the thunder roars. After the storm passes, they find a frame house down the river and explore it. Inside they find a dead man who has been shot in the back, as well as other items such as old cards, whisky bottles, masks, clothing, and a tin lantern. They take all of these items with them in their canoe when they leave and head back home.

A few days later, Jim is bitten by a rattlesnake in their camp, and the narrator realizes it was because of the snake skin he brought. Jim recovers from the bite and they catch a huge catfish. The narrator decides to cross the river to find out what's going on in town and disguises himself as a girl. He meets a woman in an abandoned shanty who helps him find his uncle Abner Moore.
