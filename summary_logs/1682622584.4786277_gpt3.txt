said. "I thought that Mrs. Forresterhad come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you.What news have you brought me?""I have brought something better than news," said I, putting down thebox upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though myheart was heavy within me. "I have brought you something which isworth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune."She glanced at iron box. "Is that the treasure, then?" she asked,coolly enough."Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and halfis Thaddeus Sholto's. You will have a couple of hundred thousandeach. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will befew richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?"I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and thatshe detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw hereyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously."If I have it," said she, "I owe it to you.""No, no," I answered, "not to me,
but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a cluewhich has taxed even his analytical genius.As it was, we verynearly lost it at the last moment.""Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson," said she.I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen herlast,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora,the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, andthe wild chase down the Thames.

It had struck her, doubtless, thatit might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prizewhich had cost so much to win."What a pretty box!" she said, stooping over it.
