Holmes encourages her to explain her case and, after listening to her, he is able to deduce information from observation and deduction. He also examines a fifty-guinea watch that has recently come into the possession of the person asking the question and is able to infer that the owner was careless and often at low water due to the dents and scratches on the watch case, as well as the number of pawnbroker tickets visible inside. He also infers that the owner had occasional bursts of prosperity due to the fact that he was able to redeem the pledge. Finally, he points out that the keyhole is covered with scratches, indicating that it was probably used by a drunkard.
