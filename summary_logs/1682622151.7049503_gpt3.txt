GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes is an unofficial consulting detective who has chosen his profession for the mental exaltation it provides. He claims no credit for his work, and his name is not seen in any newspaper. Recently, his practice has extended to the continent, and he was consulted by Francois Le Villard from the French detective service on a case involving a will. Holmes was able to refer him to two similar cases for the solution. This overview explains Holmes' career as a detective and his most recent case.
