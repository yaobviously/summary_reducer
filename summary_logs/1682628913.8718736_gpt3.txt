The old man then bullies Judge Thatcher but is unsuccessful in getting the money. To escape, Huck gathers supplies and sets off in a drift-canoe, leaving clues that make it seem like he was attacked.
Jim and the narrator are travelling down the Missouri River on a raft. Along the way, they take advantage of the darkness to stop in small villages and buy food, borrow items from cornfields, and catch fish. They also come across a steamboat that has wrecked on a rock, and debate whether or not to explore it. A woman stops a runaway 'prentice and provides them with a snack and advice before they set off on their journey. The woman also reveals that they are in St. Petersburg, not Goshen as they had thought. Finally, Jim and the narrator board the steamboat in search of something of value in the captain's stateroom.
This chapter follows the adventures of Huck and Jim as they travel down the Mississippi River on a raft. Along the way, they encounter two men, Bill and Jake Packard, who are discussing what to do with a man they have tied up. They eventually decide to leave him on the wreck and let him drown. Meanwhile, Tom Sawyer and Jim overhear their conversation and devise a plan to find their boat and set it adrift so they can't escape. Later, a young boy recounts his journey down the river on a raft with his friend Jim, who are trying to escape from a gang of criminals who have stolen their skiff. Finally, Huck and Jim discuss kings, dukes, earls, and other royalty, as well as Louis Sixteen, the French king who lost his head.
