guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass withthe dog on my mentioning the detective's name.Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets,smoking his pipe."Ah, you have him there!" said he. "Good dog, then! Athelney Joneshas gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. Hehas arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, thehousekeeper, and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves,but for a sergeant up-stairs. Leave the dog here, and come up."We tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended the stairs. The roomwas as we had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over thecentral figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in thecorner."Lend me your bull's-eye, sergeant," said my companion. "Now tie thisbit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thankyou. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.--Just you carry themdown with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip
myhandkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into thegarret with me for a moment."We clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his light once moreupon the footsteps in the dust."I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks," he said. "Do youobserve anything noteworthy about them?""They belong," I said, "to a child or a small woman.""Apart from their size, though. Is there nothing else?""They appear to be much as other footmarks.""Not at all. Look here! This is the print of a right foot in thedust. Now I make one with my naked foot beside it.

If you can trace him,I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now rundown-stairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin."By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was onthe roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawlingvery slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack ofchimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once moreupon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found himseated at one of the corner eaves."That You, Watson?" he cried."Yes.""This is the place. What is that black thing down there?""A water-barrel.""Top on it?""Yes.""No sign of a ladder?""No.""Confound the fellow! It's a most break-neck place.

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and Watson have gone to a house where a suspect is believed to be hiding. They are allowed in by the gatekeeper, and when they enter the house, they find that the police have already arrested the suspect, as well as the gatekeeper, housekeeper, and Indian servant. Holmes asks Watson to tie their dog Toby to the hall table and then they go upstairs. In the room, Holmes notices some unusual footprints and deduces that they belong to a child or small woman. He then climbs up to the attic and notices a water-barrel with a ladder next to it. He climbs down the ladder and finds that the suspect has escaped.
