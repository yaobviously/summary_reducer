Write a detailed summary of the following:


Longtermism is a radical philosophy that questions why our ancestors did not take into account the long-term effects of their decisions on climate change and biodiversity. The effective altruism movement has recently been advocating for this concept to be taken more seriously, and it is a key theme in William MacAskill's book, What We Owe the Future. Longtermism suggests that we should be focused on reducing existential risk, such as those posed by nuclear weapons or runaway artificial intelligence, in order to ensure that a future with billions or even trillions of sentient beings comes to fruition. However, this concept has been met with pushback from both the political left and right. Those on the left argue that it ignores the suffering of today's individuals, while those on the right view it as a programme for maximizing state power and creating world government. Practically, one must consider how much longtermism truly changes our decision calculus. Some suggest that investing in human talent, high-quality institutions, and flexible responses today is the best preparation for the long run, though one must consider the potential downsides of such investments. Others argue that humanity should stop research into frontier-level immunology altogether. Ultimately, disagreements over longtermism are rooted in emotions and personal temperaments.
The debate over the implications of advances in immunology has been ongoing. Some argue that it is better for non-rogue actors to have the greatest understanding possible and that the West should be ahead of China and Russia in this field in order to fend off a terror attack one day. Others have argued that banning an entire scientific field would stifle our ability to divert a large asteroid heading towards the planet. In response, the consilience approach has been proposed, which argues that human beings are impatient and will never succeed in thinking purely about the long term, so tying the long run to the short and medium runs as closely as possible is the best we can hope to achieve. However, this approach also carries the risk of turning longtermism into cloaked forms for shorter-term ambitions. Three new books have entered the debate on longtermism. Richard Fisher's book The Long View: Why We Need to Transform How the World Sees Time, is an attempt to move us away from short-termism by drawing on the time scales of geology and his own interviews for the BBC. Derek Parfit argued in his book Reasons and Persons (1984) that policy makers should not discount the future just because of its temporal distance. Jan Zielonka's book The Lost Future: And How to Reclaim It proposes a more political approach to the problem of short-termism than the philosophical approach proposed by Fisher. Rather than focusing on long-term issues such as geological time scales, Zielonka focuses on more pressing issues such as financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. His solution is to move beyond the primacy of nation-states and empower other public actors at the local and transnational level. However, this solution raises questions about the efficacy of transnational organizations in our current world, given their weakened state in recent years, and their lack of democracy. It also does not address the issue of agency relationships which lead to excess short-termism, nor does it address the need for regulation to address negative externalities of capitalism.
In Gradual: The Path to Lasting Change, authors Greg Berman and Aubrey Fox make the case for incrementalism as a viable approach to tackling big problems. They point to successful examples such as US Social Security reform, the reduction of crime in New York City and the hidden strengths of the US immigration system, which have been achieved through many small policy improvements over time. The authors argue that Congress has been passing a surprising amount of bipartisan legislation in recent years, including on matters such as climate change, and suggest that if we keep faith in gradual reform, we can achieve great things in the future. They cite Amaras Law, which states that we habitually overestimate what a new technology can accomplish in the short run and underestimate what it can accomplish in the longer run, and argue that building for the longer run requires an incrementalist perspective. However, the authors also consider cases in which incrementalism might fail. Examples of this include the Manhattan Project and Abraham Lincoln's change in view on slavery, both of which required a more drastic approach than incrementalism. The authors also question how a society can manage the integration of long-term and short-term considerations without sacrificing its incrementalist tendencies. They suggest that achieving this balance may be difficult due to the fact that different sectors and eras may require different ethical outlooks on urgency and complacency. However, they note that if social norms were more flexible, this could be managed more easily. In contrast, Zielonkas book looks at how fragile a doctrine longtermism is in the real world of fractious politics. He provides two pages of examples of how to get local politics right, ranging from greater reliance on institutions such as municipal councils to the idea of a second chamber for the European parliament. He also suggests that speakers at World Climate Summits could be selected by environmental NGOs rather than hosting governments. However, he acknowledges that this may not make a significant difference to the world's biggest long-term problems.
