PROMPT:

Once you swallow the longtermist pill, it is hard to turn back. Is there not a possible human future with many billions or perhaps even trillions of sentient beings, humans or their offshoots, colonizing the galaxy and continuing to evolve for millions or billions of years? If so, should we not do everything to ensure that this future comes about, even if it lies in the distant future? Assuming we should, that would require a contemporary obsession with existential risk – as posed by nuclear weapons, for example, or runaway artificial intelligence. Those future trillions are relying on us not to self-destruct.
There is a more prosaic version of longtermism. In most western nations current politicians seem less concerned with mounting debts and falling fertility rates than perhaps they ought to be. Common sense suggests that we should look ahead ten or twenty years and consider whether – to cite one mainstream example – the fiscal position of the United Kingdom is sustainable, given current productivity growth rates, which often verge on zero or are negative. In a given year a small boost to the rate of economic growth may not do much for human happiness, but compounded over decades or centuries it will become very large indeed. A country that grows at 1 per cent per annum will double its measured living standards every seventy years; a country that grows at 7 per cent will double its living standards roughly every decade. If you play that difference out for a few decades it ends up being substantial – a point laid out in my book Stubborn Attachments (2018). But that argument is a tough sell for politicians with pending re-elections, and to voters with pressing needs and short attention spans.

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is a way to reframe the issue. It suggests that we should think not just of our own generation, but of the generations that will follow us. It suggests that we should think not just of the next election cycle, but of the centuries ahead. It suggests that we should think not just of our own nation, but of the world as a whole. It suggests that we should think not just of our own species, but of the future of life in the universe. In short, longtermism is a way to make us think beyond our immediate interests and consider how our actions today will affect the world in the distant future. It is a way to ensure that we do not neglect our obligations to future generations, and to ensure that we do not squander our resources on short-term gains at the expense of long-term prosperity.
