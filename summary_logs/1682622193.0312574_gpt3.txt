My father was anofficer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite achild. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England.

RESPONSE:

Mary Morstan is the daughter of an Indian regiment officer who sent her home when she was a child. In 1878, her father obtained a year's leave and came to London, staying at the Langham Hotel. He went out one night and never returned. Mary communicated with the police but there were no leads. Six years later, an advertisement appeared in the Times asking for Mary's address and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. When she did, she received a small box containing a large pearl. Every year from then on, Mary has received a similar box with a pearl inside, but no clues as to who is sending them.
