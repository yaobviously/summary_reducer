Write a detailed summary of the following:


The debate over the implications of advances in immunology has been ongoing, with some arguing that it is better for non-rogue actors to have the greatest understanding possible and that the West should be ahead of China and Russia in this field in order to fend off a terror attack one day. Others have argued that banning an entire scientific field would stifle our ability to divert a large asteroid heading towards the planet. In response, the consilience approach has been proposed, which argues that human beings are impatient and will never succeed in thinking purely about the long term, so tying the long run to the short and medium runs as closely as possible is the best we can hope to achieve. However, this approach also carries the risk of turning longtermism into cloaked forms for shorter-term ambitions.
Three new books have entered the debate on longtermism, which is the idea that humanity should have a longer-term perspective when making decisions. Richard Fisher's book The Long View: Why We Need to Transform How the World Sees Time, is an attempt to move us away from short-termism. He argues that environmental neglect, two-year electoral cycles, and managers who prioritize quarterly earnings reports are all examples of short-term thinking. Fisher draws on the time scales of geology and his own interviews for the BBC to make the case for longtermism. He believes that it is possible to teach humanity a longer-term perspective, and he uses history, science and philosophy to explain how. The philosopher Derek Parfit argued in his book Reasons and Persons (1984) that policy makers should not discount the future just because of its temporal distance. Fisher and Jan Zielonka in his book The Lost Future: And How to Reclaim It make the mistake of portraying capitalism as a short-sighted economic system. However, capitalism is not as shortsighted as they suggest. Investors often put resources into companies with no revenue or support nuclear fusion, artificial intelligence or the construction of the metaverse. They are in it for the longterm benefits and well-defined property rights are important to ensure that longterm benefits are captured today.
Zielonka's book proposes a more political approach to the problem of short-termism than the philosophical approach proposed by Fisher. Rather than focusing on long-term issues such as Derek Parfit's geological time scales, the book focuses on more pressing issues such as financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. Zielonka's solution is to move beyond the primacy of nation-states and empower other public actors at the local and transnational level. However, this solution raises questions about the efficacy of transnational organizations in our current world, given their weakened state in recent years, and their lack of democracy. Furthermore, it does not address the issue of agency relationships which lead to excess short-termism, nor does it address the need for regulation to address negative externalities of capitalism.
