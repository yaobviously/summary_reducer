PROMPT:

Once you swallow the longtermist pill, it is hard to turn back. Is there not a possible human future with many billions or perhaps even trillions of sentient beings, humans or their offshoots, colonizing the galaxy and continuing to evolve for millions or billions of years? If so, should we not do everything to ensure that this future comes about, even if it lies in the distant future? Assuming we should, that would require a contemporary obsession with existential risk – as posed by nuclear weapons, for example, or runaway artificial intelligence. Those future trillions are relying on us not to self-destruct.
There is a more prosaic version of longtermism. In most western nations current politicians seem less concerned with mounting debts and falling fertility rates than perhaps they ought to be. Common sense suggests that we should look ahead ten or twenty years and consider whether – to cite one mainstream example – the fiscal position of the United Kingdom is sustainable, given current productivity growth rates, which often verge on zero or are negative. In a given year a small boost to the rate of economic growth may not do much for human happiness, but compounded over decades or centuries it will become very large indeed. A country that grows at 1 per cent per annum will double its measured living standards every seventy years; a country that grows at 7 per cent will double its living standards roughly every decade. If you play that difference out for a few decades it ends up being substantial – a point laid out in my book Stubborn Attachments (2018). But that argument is a tough sell for politicians with pending re-elections, and to voters with pressing needs and short attention spans.

RESPONSE:

Longtermism, as I have defined it, is a moral commitment to the distant future. It is a commitment to the idea that we should be doing everything in our power to ensure that the distant future is as good as possible. This means taking into account not only our own short-term interests, but also those of future generations. It means taking into account not only our own material gain, but also the moral and ethical implications of our decisions. It means taking into account not only our own immediate needs, but also the long-term consequences of our actions. Longtermism is a call to action – a call to think and act beyond the present moment and beyond our own narrow interests. It is a call to ensure that the future is as good as it can be for everyone, now and in the future.
