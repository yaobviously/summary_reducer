put each of us in a palace if we could only have made useof it. It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to standthe kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice toeat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for himoutside, just waiting to be picked up. It might have driven me mad;but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bidedmy time."At last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra toMadras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There arevery few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behavedwell from the first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person.I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopesof Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is adreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings wasinfested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow apoisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging,
andditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, sowe were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a littletime to ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugsfor the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All thetime I was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundredsof miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in thoseseas: so it was a terribly difficult job to get away."The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and theother young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and playcards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to hissitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I feltlonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then,standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I amfond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as havingone to watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan,
andLieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops,and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials,crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug littleparty they used to make."Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that wasthat the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind,I don't say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. Theseprison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they hadbeen at the Andamans, and they knew each other's game to a point,while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cardsdown anyhow. Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, andthe poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto wasthe hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soonit came to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win fora few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set inagainst him worse than ever.
