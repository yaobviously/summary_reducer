nothing. How could you possibly tellthat it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don'tquite understand how you can be so sure.""His voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o' thick and foggy.He tapped at the winder,--about three it would be. 'Show a leg,matey,' says he: 'time to turn out guard.' My old man woke upJim,--that's my eldest,--and away they went, without so much as aword to me. I could hear the wooden leg clackin' on the stones.""And was this wooden-legged man alone?""Couldn't say, I am sure, sir. I didn't hear no one else.""I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I haveheard good reports of the--Let me see, what is her name?""The Aurora, sir.""Ah! She's not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broadin the beam?""No, indeed. She's as trim a little thing as any on the river. She'sbeen fresh painted, black with two red streaks.""Thanks. I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith. I am goingdown the river; and if I should see
anything of the Aurora I shalllet him know that you are uneasy. A black funnel, you say?""No, sir. Black with a white band.""Ah, of course. It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs.Smith.--There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall takeit and cross the river."The main thing with people of that sort," said Holmes, as we sat inthe sheets of the wherry, "is never to let them think that theirinformation can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do,they will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to themunder protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.""Our course now seems pretty clear," said I."What would you do, then?""I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of theAurora.""My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. She may have touched atany wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich.Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places formiles. It would take you days and days
to exhaust them, if you setabout it alone.""Employ the police, then.""No. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. Heis not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which wouldinjure him professionally. But I have a fancy for working it outmyself, now that we have gone so far.""Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?""Worse and worse! Our men would know that the chase was hot at theirheels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they arelikely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectlysafe they will be in no hurry. Jones's energy will be of use to usthere, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the dailypress, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrongscent.""What are we to do, then?" I asked, as we landed near MillbankPenitentiary."Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour'ssleep. It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are investigating the disappearance of a steam launch called the Aurora. They visit a woman whose husband was taken away with the man in the wooden leg. Holmes and Watson then cross the river in a wherry and discuss their plan of action. Holmes suggests they advertise asking for information from wharfingers, but decides against it because it will alert the runaways that they are being pursued. Instead, he suggests they take a hansom cab, go home, have breakfast, and get some sleep before possibly going out at night.
