PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

Yes, it is true that our ancestors did not always consider the long-term effects of their decisions, and this has had a significant impact on our environment today. We must learn from this mistake and strive to make decisions that are mindful of the future. We must think beyond our own lifetime and consider the consequences of our actions for future generations. By doing so, we can ensure that our descendants do not have to suffer the same consequences that our ancestors have.
