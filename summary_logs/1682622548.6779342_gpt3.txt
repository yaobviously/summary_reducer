any question aboutit. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. AtBlackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. Ihave coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkeredcareer, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad,flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yardby yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting andclanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched uponthe deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, whileevery now and then he would look up and measure with a glance thedistance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jonesyelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat's lengthsbehind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clearreach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and themelancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man inthe stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two
clinched fists atus, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride Icould see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stumpupon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries therewas movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straighteneditself into a little black man--the smallest I have ever seen--with agreat, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair.Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at thesight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sortof dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but thatface was enough to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seenfeatures so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His smalleyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips werewrithed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with ahalf animal fury."Fire if he raises his
hand," said Holmes, quietly. We were within aboat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. Ican see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with hislegs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf withhis hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in thelight of our lantern.It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked heplucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood,like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang outtogether. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind ofchoking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse ofhis venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. Atthe same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudderand put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for thesouthern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by afew feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was

==========

RESPONSE:

In this narrative, the narrator and their companion are in pursuit of two men in a boat on the Thames. As they draw closer, they see that the man in the stern is a powerful figure with a wooden leg, and the other is a small black man with a disheveled shock of hair and a menacing face. The small man pulls out a piece of wood and the pursuers fire their pistols, causing him to fall into the river. The wooden-legged man steers the boat towards the southern bank, just missing them as they pass by. The pursuers quickly turn around and chase after them, but eventually lose them.
