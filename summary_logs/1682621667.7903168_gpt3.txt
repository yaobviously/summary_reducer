Write a general summary or overview of the following.


This debate considers whether advances in immunology should be pursued, even if there is fear of potential rogue actors exploiting the knowledge. It is argued that the West should stay ahead of China and Russia in this field, and that a government banning an entire scientific field would lead to stagnation. The consilience approach is proposed as an alternative, where long-term thinking is important to help think more clearly about the short and medium term, but can be dangerous if it is used to mask short-term political ambitions.
In The Long View: Why we need to transform how the world sees time, Richard Fisher argues that humanity needs to move away from short-termism and embrace long-term perspectives. He draws on history, science, and philosophy to explain how this can be achieved. Jan Zielonka's The Lost Future: And how to reclaim it also promotes a long-term view, though both authors mistakenly portray capitalism as a short-sighted economic system. In reality, capitalism rewards patience and long-term thinking, and well-defined property rights can help ensure that resources are used in a sustainable manner.
In Zielonka's book, he argues that the agency relationship and habitual firing for inferior short-term performance, rather than capitalism, leads to excess short-termism. He proposes that moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level is a remedy for the current world's financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. However, there is a suspicion that transnational institutions will be far from democratic, as seen in the European Union.


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

This debate examines the pros and cons of advancing immunology in light of the potential for rogue actors to exploit this knowledge. Arguments are made for staying ahead of China and Russia in this field, as well as for a government ban on the entire scientific field. Richard Fisher and Jan Zielonka both propose a long-term approach to decision-making, with Fisher emphasizing the importance of history, science, and philosophy to help achieve this, and Zielonka arguing that moving beyond nation-states is a remedy for current global crises. However, there is suspicion that transnational institutions will lack democracy.
