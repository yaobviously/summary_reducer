his horse, and we plunged awayat a furious pace through the foggy streets.The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place,on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a completehoax,--which was an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we had goodreason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey.Miss Morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. Iendeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventuresin Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited atour situation and so curious as to our destination that my storieswere slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her onemoving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead ofnight, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first Ihad some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon,what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London,I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed
to be goinga very long way. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and hemuttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and outby tortuous by-streets."Rochester Row," said he. "Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on theVauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently.Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpsesof the river."We did indeed bet a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with thelamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on,and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side."Wordsworth Road," said my companion. "Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane.Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest does notappear to take us to very fashionable regions."We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood.Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarseglare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then camerows of two-storied villas
each with a fronting of miniature garden,and then again interminable lines of new staring brickbuildings,--the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwingout into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in anew terrace. None of the other houses were inhabited, and that atwhich we stopped was as dark as its neighbors, save for a singleglimmer in the kitchen window. On our knocking, however, the door wasinstantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban,white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. There was somethingstrangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in thecommonplace door-way of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house."The Sahib awaits you," said he, and even as he spoke there came ahigh piping voice from some inner room. "Show them in to me,khitmutgar," it cried. "Show them straight in to me."
