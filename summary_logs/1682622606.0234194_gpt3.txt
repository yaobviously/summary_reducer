have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth isthat I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if theywould be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-goingfolk, small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side,while I was always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I wasabout eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a messover a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen'sshilling and joining the 3d Buffs, which was just starting for India."I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just gotpast the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was foolenough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my companysergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he wasone of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, justas I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as asurgeon could have done it, just above the knee. What with the
shockand the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holderhad not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five monthsin hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of itwith this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalidedout of the army and unfitted for any active occupation."I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, forI was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However,my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man namedAbelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted anoverseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. Hehappened to be a friend of our colonel's, who had taken an interestin me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonelrecommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly tobe done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enoughknee left to keep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was
toride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked,and to report the idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortablequarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of mylife in indigo-planting. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he wouldoften drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for whitefolk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never dohere at home."Well, I was never in luck's way long. Suddenly, without a note ofwarning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as stilland peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next therewere two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country wasa perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a dealmore than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I onlyknow what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a placecalled Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Nightafter night the whole sky was alight with the burning
