PROMPT:

Don’t you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Won’t our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskill’s bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).

RESPONSE:

The idea is simple, yet powerful: we should consider the long-term consequences of our actions and prioritize those that will have the greatest positive impact over the longest period of time. This means that we should be more willing to make sacrifices in the present in order to secure a better future for our descendants. In terms of climate change and biodiversity, this means that we must take meaningful steps now to reduce our emissions and protect vulnerable ecosystems. We must also invest in renewable energy sources, invest in carbon capture technology, and promote sustainable land use practices. We must also work to reduce the number of species going extinct by protecting their habitats and promoting conservation efforts. By considering our decisions from a long-term perspective, we can ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy a healthy planet with abundant resources. We owe it to them to act now.
