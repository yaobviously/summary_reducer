stood here for some time," I suggested."Ah! it's all right. He's off again," said my companion, in a tone ofrelief.He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made uphis mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as hehad not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before,for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at hisleash and tried to break into a run. I cold see by the gleam inHolmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick andNelson's large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Herethe dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gateinto the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On thedog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round apassage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp,sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley onwhich it had
been brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes,Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us forsome sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels ofthe trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air washeavy with the smell of creasote.Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burstsimultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.

"Toby has lost his character for infallibility.""He acted according to his lights," said Holmes, lifting him downfrom the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. "If youconsider how much creasote is carted about London in one day, it isno great wonder that our trail should have been crossed. It is muchused now, especially for the seasoning of wood.

GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and his companion followed the scent of a dog, Toby, who had been tracking something down. They followed the scent down Nine Elms, past the White Eagle tavern, and into a timber-yard. Toby was frantic with excitement, and eventually led them to a large barrel smeared with a dark liquid, which was creasote. Realizing they had taken the wrong trail, they followed the other trail which led them to the edge of a wooden wharf. There they discovered that the object they were tracking had gone by boat.
