Dont you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Wont our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskills bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).
Once you swallow the longtermist pill, it is hard to turn back. Is there not a possible human future with many billions or perhaps even trillions of sentient beings, humans or their offshoots, colonizing the galaxy and continuing to evolve for millions or billions of years? If so, should we not do everything to ensure that this future comes about, even if it lies in the distant future? Assuming we should, that would require a contemporary obsession with existential risk  as posed by nuclear weapons, for example, or runaway artificial intelligence. Those future trillions are relying on us not to self-destruct.
There is a more prosaic version of longtermism. In most western nations current politicians seem less concerned with mounting debts and falling fertility rates than perhaps they ought to be. Common sense suggests that we should look ahead ten or twenty years and consider whether  to cite one mainstream example  the fiscal position of the United Kingdom is sustainable, given current productivity growth rates, which often verge on zero or are negative. In a given year a small boost to the rate of economic growth may not do much for human happiness, but compounded over decades or centuries it will become very large indeed. A country that grows at 1 per cent per annum will double its measured living standards every seventy years; a country that grows at 7 per cent will double its living standards roughly every decade. If you play that difference out for a few decades it ends up being substantial  a point laid out in my book Stubborn Attachments (2018). But that argument is a tough sell for politicians with pending re-elections, and to voters with pressing needs and short attention spans.
The broader pushback against longtermism is increasingly fierce. The philosopher mile P. Torres wrote a polemic for Aeon, Against longtermism (October 19, 2021), which described the movement as both richly funded and quite possibly the most dangerous secular belief system in the world today. Torress fear, quite simply, is that longtermism can too frequently be used to obliterate the demands of the present and ignore the suffering of todays individuals. This critique comes primarily from the political left, which commonly cites instances of human suffering to which, it is argued, the polity is obliged to respond. But in the longtermist framework this argument can never be the full picture, and there are always reasons to limit our obligations to those who are suffering today. Alleviation may help individuals in the short run, but more collective good might be done by allocating resources to innovation or disaster mitigation, such as protecting the Earth against an asteroid hit. Perhaps the long term is intrinsically difficult to predict, but that in turn means our obligations to the present become highly uncertain, because the pull of potential future benefits is never absent from our calculations.
I have found that many advocates of longtermism favour the analytic mode and consequently de- emphasize the empathetic mode of political argument. That is one reason why longtermism is so controversial. The complicated nature of long-term arguments means that they are most commonly put forward by people with analytical inclinations. The kinds of arguments and discourse that are corralled in support of longtermism emerge from fields such as economics, rational choice theory and ethics, game theory and analytic philosophy. That may be a bug or a feature, depending on your point of view. Either way, the true disagreements over longtermism, as with most political concerns, remain foundationally rooted in our emotions and our personal temperaments.


DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is a radical, neglected philosophy that is beginning to gain traction in philosophical and political circles, with the effective altruism movement leading the charge. It suggests that we should plan for a future with many billions or even trillions of sentient beings, and do everything to ensure that this future comes about, even if it lies in the distant future. This means focusing on reducing existential risk and making sure current debt and fertility rates are sustainable. However, there is a lot of pushback against longtermism from the political left, who argue that it ignores the suffering of present individuals. Longtermism is often seen as an analytical argument, as it draws from fields such as economics, rational choice theory and ethics, game theory and analytic philosophy. However, disagreements over longtermism are ultimately rooted in emotions and personal temperaments.
