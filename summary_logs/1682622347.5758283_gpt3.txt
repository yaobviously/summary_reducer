brother last night. Thebrother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure.How's that?""On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the dooron the inside.""Hum! There's a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter.This Thaddeus Sholto was with his brother; there was a quarrel; somuch we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So muchalso we know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him.His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a mostdisturbed state of mind. His appearance is--well, not attractive. Yousee that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to closeupon him.""You are not quite in possession of the facts yet," said Holmes."This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to bepoisoned, was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; thiscard, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it laythis rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fitinto
your theory?""Confirms it in every respect," said the fat detective, pompously."House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, andif this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have mademurderous use of it as any other man. The card is somehocus-pocus,--a blind, as like as not. The only question is, how didhe depart? Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof." With greatactivity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezedthrough into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard hisexulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door."He can find something," remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders."He has occasional glimmerings of reason. Il n'y a pas des sots siincommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!""You see!" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again."Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the caseis confirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, andit is partly open.""It was I who opened
it.""Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?" He seemed a little crestfallenat the discovery. "Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how ourgentleman got away. Inspector!""Yes, sir," from the passage."Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.--Mr. Sholto, it is my duty toinform you that anything which you may say will be used against you.I arrest you in the Queen's name as being concerned in the death ofyour brother.""There, now! Didn't I tell you!" cried the poor little man, throwingout his hands, and looking from one to the other of us."Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto," said Holmes. "I thinkthat I can engage to clear you of the charge.""Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist,--don't promise too much!"snapped the detective. "You may find it a harder matter than youthink.""Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a freepresent of the name and description of one of the two people who werein this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, isJonathan Small. He

RESPONSE:

In this passage, Sherlock Holmes is discussing the case of Thaddeus Sholto with Athelney Jones. They know that Thaddeus's brother died in a fit and that Thaddeus walked away with the treasure. Holmes uses his reasoning to try to prove that Thaddeus is responsible for his brother's death, and he finds a poisoned splinter, a card, and a stone-headed instrument in the room. The detective then arrests Thaddeus, but Holmes promises to clear him of the charge. He also reveals that one of the two people in the room was Jonathan Small.
