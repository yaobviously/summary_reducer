PROMPT:

The broader pushback against longtermism is increasingly fierce. The philosopher Émile P. Torres wrote a polemic for Aeon, “Against longtermism” (October 19, 2021), which described the movement as both “richly funded” and “quite possibly the most dangerous secular belief system in the world today”. Torres’s fear, quite simply, is that longtermism can too frequently be used to obliterate the demands of the present and ignore the suffering of today’s individuals. This critique comes primarily from the political left, which commonly cites instances of human suffering to which, it is argued, the polity is obliged to respond. But in the longtermist framework this argument can never be the full picture, and there are always reasons to limit our obligations to those who are suffering today. Alleviation may help individuals in the short run, but more collective good might be done by allocating resources to innovation or disaster mitigation, such as protecting the Earth against an asteroid hit. Perhaps the long term is intrinsically difficult to predict, but that in turn means our obligations to the present become highly uncertain, because the pull of potential future benefits is never absent from our calculations.
I have found that many advocates of longtermism favour the analytic mode and consequently de- emphasize the empathetic mode of political argument. That is one reason why longtermism is so controversial. The complicated nature of long-term arguments means that they are most commonly put forward by people with analytical inclinations. The kinds of arguments and discourse that are corralled in support of longtermism emerge from fields such as economics, rational choice theory and ethics, game theory and analytic philosophy. That may be a bug or a feature, depending on your point of view. Either way, the true disagreements over longtermism, as with most political concerns, remain foundationally rooted in our emotions and our personal temperaments.

RESPONSE:

The controversy over longtermism is ultimately rooted in our own values and beliefs. On one side of the debate, longtermists believe that it is our duty to consider the long-term consequences of our actions, even if it means sacrificing the interests of today’s individuals. On the other side, critics of longtermism argue that the present should be prioritized over the future, and that any attempt to prioritize the future over the present will only lead to suffering and injustice. Both sides of the debate have valid points, and it is important to consider both perspectives when making decisions. Ultimately, however, it is up to each individual to decide which values they prioritize when making decisions.
