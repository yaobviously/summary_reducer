PROMPT:

Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.
But are the transnational organizations in our current world so far-sighted? Have not most of them collapsed or weakened greatly in recent years, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization? What exactly is supposed to protect these organizations from a more general and rampant short-sightedness? (They are, by the way, full of agency relationships as criticized above.) Furthermore, since most electorates are locally or nationally defined, it is hard to resist the suspicion that transnational institutions will be far from democratic. The European Union, for all its virtues and successes, does not escape this charge.

RESPONSE:

Zielonka's book does not offer a comprehensive solution to the world's problems, but it does remind us of the importance of thinking on a global scale in order to address them. It stresses the need for more effective international collaboration, and for governments to take a more active role in protecting their citizens from the worst effects of climate change, energy shortages, and financial crises. The book also encourages us to think more critically about how our current global system is structured and how it could be improved. While some of the remedies proposed may not be particularly revolutionary, they are nevertheless essential if we are to address the world's most pressing issues.
