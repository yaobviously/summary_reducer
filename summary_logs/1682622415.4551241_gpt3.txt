GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Sherlock Holmes and his companion are pursuing two men who have taken a zigzag route through the streets of London. They are being guided by Toby, a dog, who is running backwards and forwards, seemingly unable to make up his mind as to which direction to take. As they make their way through Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and Kennington Lane, they pass laborers and dockmen beginning their days, slatternly women taking down shutters and brushing doorsteps, and strange dogs that stare at them. Holmes remarks on the smallness of human ambition in the presence of nature's great elemental forces. He suggests that they may need a weapon if they reach their quarry's lair.
