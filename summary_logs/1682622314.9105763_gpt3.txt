jarringto the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face tothat of our little friend that I looked round at him to make surethat he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he hadmentioned to us that his brother and he were twins."This is terrible!" I said to Holmes. "What is to be done?""The door must come down," he answered, and, springing against it, heput all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did notyield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this timeit gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves withinBartholomew Sholto's chamber.It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A doubleline of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall oppositethe door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners,test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid inwicker baskets. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken,for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it,
and theair was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor. A set ofsteps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lathand plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling largeenough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a longcoil of rope was thrown carelessly together.By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house wasseated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, andthat ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold,and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not onlyhis features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the mostfantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiarinstrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like ahammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a tornsheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glancedat it, and then handed it to me."You see," he said, with a significant raising of
the eyebrows.In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, "Thesign of the four.""In God's name, what does it all mean?" I asked."It means murder," said he, stooping over the dead man. "Ah, Iexpected it. Look here!" He pointed to what looked like a long, darkthorn stuck in the skin just above the ear."It looks like a thorn," said I."It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it ispoisoned."I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skinso readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck ofblood showed where the puncture had been."This is all an insoluble mystery to me," said I. "It grows darkerinstead of clearer.""On the contrary," he answered, "it clears every instant. I onlyrequire a few missing links to have an entirely connected case."We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered thechamber. He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture ofterror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself.


GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

Holmes and Watson investigate the strange death of Bartholomew Sholto, and upon entering his chamber, they find it fitted up as a chemical laboratory. There is a double line of glass-stoppered bottles on the wall, Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts in the corners. The master of the house is found dead in a wooden armchair with an odd instrument and a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled on it. Holmes explains that the words point to murder, and upon further investigation, finds a poisoned thorn stuck in the skin above the ear. With this evidence, he believes he can soon solve the mystery.
