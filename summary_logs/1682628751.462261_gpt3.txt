To prove their innocence, the group decides to take the newcomers to a nearby tavern and compare them to another couple who were claiming to be related to Peter Wilks.

Everyone agrees and they set off for the graveyard, with the King and four other men in tow. When they arrive, they are unable to find a lantern and send someone to borrow one from a nearby house. After much digging, they find the coffin and unscrew the lid to find a bag of gold on the deceased's chest with a small dim P, B (initial he dropped when he was young) and W with dashes between them. The main character takes advantage of the distraction to escape and runs for home, where he finds his house in darkness but is relieved to see the light in his sister's window.
