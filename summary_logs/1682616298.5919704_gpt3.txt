PROMPT:

A better argument would be that the agency relationship (and habitual firing for inferior short-term performance), rather than capitalism, leads to excess short-termism. Capitalism has plenty of agency relationships, of course, but so do all other systems, including politics and the charitable sector. At least under capitalism there is an incentive to terminate or alter the most destructive agency relationships, precisely because they reduce longer-term wealth. As for the negative externalities of capitalism, for example in the form of carbon emissions, regulation is needed to solve those problems, not more patient behaviour in the markets; and in that sense the issue is not one of short- vs longtermism at all.
Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.

RESPONSE:

Such a suggestion is not radical, but it is a step in the right direction. A better argument would be that the short-termism of capitalism is only one of many factors that contribute to negative externalities such as climate change. In order to address these issues, we need to look beyond the economic system and consider other factors such as politics, the media, and public opinion. Regulation is necessary to ensure that businesses are held accountable for their actions, but this must be accompanied by an increase in public awareness and education about environmental issues. Furthermore, we need to create incentives for businesses to invest in sustainable practices and technologies, such as renewable energy sources. Finally, we need to recognize that short-termism is only one part of the problem and that long-term solutions must be sought in order to ensure a sustainable future.
