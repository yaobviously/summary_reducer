Write a detailed summary of the following:


Dont you wish our ancestors had cared more about the long term when they made decisions affecting human impact on climate change and biodiversity? Wont our descendants wish we had done the same?
These may sound like simple, obvious questions, but longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, and few people are interested in living by its implications. It is, however, belatedly surfacing as a significant concept in philosophical and political debate. The effective altruism movement has spearheaded the charge, the subject a key theme of William MacAskills bestseller What We Owe the Future (2022).
Once you swallow the longtermist pill, it is hard to turn back. Is there not a possible human future with many billions or perhaps even trillions of sentient beings, humans or their offshoots, colonizing the galaxy and continuing to evolve for millions or billions of years? If so, should we not do everything to ensure that this future comes about, even if it lies in the distant future? Assuming we should, that would require a contemporary obsession with existential risk  as posed by nuclear weapons, for example, or runaway artificial intelligence. Those future trillions are relying on us not to self-destruct.


DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is a radical and oft-neglected philosophy, which questions why our ancestors did not take into account the long-term effects of their decisions on climate change and biodiversity. The effective altruism movement has recently been pushing for this concept to be taken more seriously, and it is a key theme in William MacAskill's book, What We Owe the Future. Longtermism suggests that we should be thinking about the potential human future with billions or even trillions of sentient beings, humans or their offshoots, colonizing the galaxy and continuing to evolve for millions or billions of years. This means that we should be focused on reducing existential risk, such as those posed by nuclear weapons or runaway artificial intelligence, in order to ensure that this future comes to fruition. Our descendants are relying on us to make the right decisions now in order to ensure their future.
