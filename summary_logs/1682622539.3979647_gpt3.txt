engineer. Make after that launch with theyellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she provesto have the heels of us!"She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behindtwo or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed upbefore we saw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to theshore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her andshook his head."She is very fast," he said. "I doubt if we shall catch her.""We must catch her!" cried Holmes, between his teeth. "Heap it on,stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must havethem!"We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerfulengines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp,steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves toright and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprangand quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in ourbows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in
front of us. Rightahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and theswirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she wasgoing. We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in andout, behind this one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of thedarkness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followedclose upon her track."Pile it on, men, pile it on!" cried Holmes, looking down into theengine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,aquiline face. "Get every pound of steam you can.""I think we gain a little," said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora."I am sure of it," said I. "We shall be up with her in a very fewminutes."At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug withthree barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by puttingour helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we couldround them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good twohundred yards. She was still, however,
well in view, and the murkyuncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Ourboilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibratedand creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We hadshot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the longDeptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. Thedull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into thedainty Aurora. Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that wecould plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by thestern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped.Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog.

GENERAL SUMMARY OR OVERVIEW:

==========

RESPONSE:

In this passage, a group of people are chasing after a boat called the Aurora. The boat is going at a tremendous rate and the pursuers are using their powerful engine to try to catch up. They narrowly avoid a collision with a tug boat with three barges in tow, and eventually they can see the figures on the Aurora's deck. One man is sitting with something black between his knees and a dark mass that looks like a Newfoundland dog is lying beside him. The boy is at the tiller, while old Smith is shovelling coals for dear life. It becomes clear that the pursuers are in fact chasing the Aurora, and they continue to follow it until the end of the passage.
