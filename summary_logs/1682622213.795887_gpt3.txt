The only person in London whom he could have visited isMajor Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London.Four years later Sholto dies. Within a week of his death CaptainMorstan's daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeatedfrom year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes heras a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except thisdeprivation of her father? And why should the presents beginimmediately after Sholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's heirknows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? Haveyou any alternative theory which will meet the facts?""But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too,should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, theletter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can
she have? It istoo much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no otherinjustice in her case that you know of.""There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties," saidSherlock Holmes, pensively.

By the way, a curious paper was found in papa'sdesk which no one could understand.

RESPONSE:

In April 1882, Captain Morstan disappeared and four years later, Major Sholto, the only person in London he could have visited, died. Shortly after his death, Captain Morstan's daughter receives a valuable present every year, culminating in a letter describing her as a wronged woman. Sherlock Holmes and Miss Morstan embark on an expedition to solve the mystery. During the expedition, Miss Morstan reveals that Major Sholto was a particular friend of her father's and she has brought a paper found in her father's desk that no one can understand. The paper appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. There is a small cross in red ink with the words '3.37 from left' written beside it and a hieroglyphic in the left-hand corner.
