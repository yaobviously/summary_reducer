He invites Miss Morstan, Sherlock Holmes, and Dr. Watson into his little sanctum which is filled with luxurious furnishings.

Mr. Sholto is a man of refined tastes who lives with some atmosphere of elegance around him. He has invited Miss Morstan and her friends to his home in order to discuss something confidential with them. He suggests they all go to Norwood to confront Brother Bartholomew, who is very angry with Mr. Sholto for taking a certain course. Mr. Sholto offers them wine and tobacco, and expresses his desire for privacy without any interference from police or officials. He also expresses his confidence in his man Williams' discretion.
