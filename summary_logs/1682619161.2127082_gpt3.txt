PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:


In Gradual: The case for incremental change in a radical age, authors Greg Berman and Aubrey Fox make the case for muddling through as a viable approach to tackling big problems. They point to successful examples such as US Social Security reform, the reduction of crime in New York City and the hidden strengths of the US immigration system, which have been achieved through many small policy improvements over time. The authors argue that Congress has been passing a surprising amount of bipartisan legislation in recent years, including on matters such as climate change, and suggest that if we keep faith in gradual reform, we can achieve great things in the future. They cite Amaras Law, which states that we habitually overestimate what a new technology can accomplish in the short run and underestimate what it can accomplish in the longer run, and argue that building for the longer run requires an incrementalist perspective. In contrast, Zielonkas book looks at how fragile a doctrine longtermism is in the real world of fractious politics. He provides two pages of examples of how to get local politics right, ranging from greater reliance on institutions such as municipal councils to the idea of a second chamber for the European parliament. He also suggests that speakers at World Climate Summits could be selected by environmental NGOs rather than hosting governments. However, he acknowledges that this may not make a significant difference to the world's biggest long-term problems.
The book Gradual: The Path to Lasting Change reviews the idea of incrementalism, or making small changes over time to achieve a desired result. While this approach is seen as practical and satisfying, the authors do not consider the cases in which it might fail. Examples of this include the Manhattan Project and Abraham Lincoln's change in view on slavery, both of which required a more drastic approach than incrementalism. The authors also question how a society can manage the integration of long-term and short-term considerations without sacrificing its incrementalist tendencies. They suggest that achieving this balance may be difficult due to the fact that different sectors and eras may require different ethical outlooks on urgency and complacency. However, they note that if social norms were more flexible, this could be managed more easily.
