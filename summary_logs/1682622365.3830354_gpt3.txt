support, and I had found her bright and placid by theside of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she firstturned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,--so sorelyhad she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told mesince that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. Shelittle guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort ofself-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went outto her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of theconventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, bravenature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were twothoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She wasweak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at adisadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still,she was rich. If Holmes's researches were successful, she would be anheiress. Was it fair, was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeonshould take such
advantage of an intimacy which chance had broughtabout? Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? Icould not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind.This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us.It was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester's.

stole a glance back, and I still seem tosee that little group on the step, the two graceful, clingingfigures, the half-opened door, the hall light shining through stainedglass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods. It was soothing tocatch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in themidst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us.And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker itgrew.
