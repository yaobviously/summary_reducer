verysingular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkableweapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those uponCaptain Morstan's chart,--here was indeed a labyrinth in which a manless singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair ofever finding the clue.Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in thelower quarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3before I could make my impression. At last, however, there was theglint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at theupper window."Go on, you drunken vagabone," said the face. "If you kick up anymore row I'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs uponyou.""If you'll let one out it's just what I have come for," said I."Go on!" yelled the voice. "So help me gracious, I have a wiper inthe bag, an' I'll drop it on your 'ead if you don't hook it.""But I want a dog," I cried."I won't be argued with!" shouted Mr. Sherman. "Now stand clear, forwhen I say 'three,'
down goes the wiper.""Mr. Sherlock Holmes--" I began, but the words had a most magicaleffect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minutethe door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean oldman, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tintedglasses."A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome," said he."Step in,sir. Keep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty,would you take a nip at the gentleman?" This to a stoat which thrustits wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage. "Don'tmind that, sir: it's only a slow-worm. It hain't got no fangs, so Igives it the run o' the room, for it keeps the bettles down. You mustnot mind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first, for I'm guyedat by the children, and there's many a one just comes down this laneto knock me up. What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?""He wanted a dog of yours.""Ah! that would be Toby.""Yes, Toby was the name.""Toby lives at No. 7 on the left
here." He moved slowly forward withhis candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered roundhim. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that therewere glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every crannyand corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemnfowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other asour voices disturbed their slumbers.Toby proved to an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spanieland half lurcher, brown-and-white in color, with a very clumsywaddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugarwhich the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed analliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties aboutaccompanying me.
