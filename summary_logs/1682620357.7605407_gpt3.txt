Write an executive summary of the following:


Longtermism is a philosophy that considers the impact of decisions on future generations, and is gaining traction in philosophical and political circles. It suggests that we should strive to ensure a positive future for many billions of sentient beings, which requires us to focus on reducing existential risks posed by nuclear weapons and runaway artificial intelligence. This idea has been met with skepticism from both the left and the right, as some question whether longtermists are even capable of longterm thinking themselves. Ultimately, disagreements over longtermism are rooted in our emotions and personal temperaments, and there is a need to consider the potential downsides of investing in talent and good institutions.
This debate explores the implications of advances in immunology, whether it is better for non-rogue actors to have the greatest understanding possible, and the potential risks of a government banning an entire scientific field. Three new books - Richard Fisher's The Long View: Why We Need to Transform How the World Sees Time, Derek Parfit's Reasons and Persons (1984) and Jan Zielonka's The Lost Future: And How to Reclaim It  add to the debate by examining the potential of long-term perspectives, arguing for policy makers not discounting the future and portraying capitalism as a short-sighted economic system. Zielonka proposes moving beyond nation-states, but raises questions about the ability of transnational organizations to resist short-termism and remain democratic, and argues that agency relationships, not capitalism, are responsible for excess short-termism.
Gradual: The Case for Incremental Change in a Radical Age is a book that examines the merits of an incrementalist approach to social and economic reform. Authors Greg Berman and Aubrey Fox argue that small policy changes over time can lead to successful reform and cite examples such as US Social Security reform, the reduction of crime in New York City, and the strength of the US immigration system as evidence. They also point to the Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021 as an example of bipartisan legislation that could have long-term effects. The authors suggest that their incrementalist approach is the best option for achieving long-term success, and cite Amaras Law which states that we often overestimate what a technology can do in the short run and underestimate what it can do in the longer run. This book also considers potential pitfalls of an incrementalist view, such as its inability to provide moral and emotional capital for revolutionaries when needed, and the need for different ethics of urgency and complacency in different sectors of society.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Longtermism is a growing philosophy that suggests we should strive to ensure a positive future for many billions of sentient beings, which requires us to focus on reducing existential risks posed by nuclear weapons and runaway artificial intelligence. This debate has been explored in several new books, such as The Long View: Why We Need to Transform How the World Sees Time, Reasons and Persons (1984), The Lost Future: And How to Reclaim It, and Gradual: The Case for Incremental Change in a Radical Age. These books examine the potential of long-term perspectives, argue for policy makers not discounting the future, portray capitalism as a short-sighted economic system, and suggest an incrementalist approach to social and economic reform. Ultimately, disagreements over longtermism are rooted in our emotions and personal temperaments, and there is a need to consider the potential downsides of investing in talent and good institutions.
