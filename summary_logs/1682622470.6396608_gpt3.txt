for I don't think it is at all likely thatwe shall have any use for him now."I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with ahalf-sovereign, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane. AtCamberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night'sadventures, but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, wasfull of curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing,however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although Ispoke of Mr. Sholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner andmethod of it. With all my omissions, however, there was enough tostartle and amaze them."It is a romance!" cried Mrs. Forrester. "An injured lady, half amillion in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian.They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.""And two knight-errants to the rescue," added Miss Morstan, with abright glance at me."Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. Idon't think that you are nearly excited
enough. Just imagine what itmust be to be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!"It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showedno sign of elation at the prospect. On the contrary, she gave a tossof her proud head, as though the matter were one in which she tooksmall interest."It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious," she said. "Nothingelse is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved mostkindly and honorably throughout.

I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, butthere was none."I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out," I said to Mrs. Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds."No, sir. He has gone to his room, sir. Do you know, sir," sinkingher voice into an impressive whisper, "I am afraid for his health?""Why
so, Mrs. Hudson?""Well, he's that strange, sir. After you was gone he walked and hewalked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the soundof his footstep. Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering,and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with 'Whatis that, Mrs. Hudson?' And now he has slammed off to his room, but Ican hear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he's not going tobe ill, sir. I ventured to say something to him about coolingmedicine, but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don'tknow how ever I got out of the room.""I don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson," Ianswered. "I have seen him like this before. He has some small matterupon his mind which makes him restless." I tried to speak lightly toour worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when throughthe long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of histread, and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against thisinvoluntary
