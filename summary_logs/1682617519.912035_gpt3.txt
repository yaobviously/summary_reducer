PROMPT:

Zielonka’s book offer a more political, less philosophical vision than that laid out by Fisher. The author’s chief concerns are financial crises, energy shortages, climate change and war. We are given less Derek Parfit and geological time scales, and more Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. The print is large and no single line of enquiry lingers for too long. For these reasons the remedies laid out in the book will come across to many as pedestrian. For example: “I propose moving beyond the primacy of nation-states and empowering other public actors at the local and transnational level”.
But are the transnational organizations in our current world so far-sighted? Have not most of them collapsed or weakened greatly in recent years, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization? What exactly is supposed to protect these organizations from a more general and rampant short-sightedness? (They are, by the way, full of agency relationships as criticized above.) Furthermore, since most electorates are locally or nationally defined, it is hard to resist the suspicion that transnational institutions will be far from democratic. The European Union, for all its virtues and successes, does not escape this charge.

RESPONSE:

Zielonka acknowledges these issues and does not offer easy answers. He argues that it is necessary to create a new kind of global citizenship, one that is not defined by nation-states but by a shared commitment to justice and solidarity. He also calls for the creation of new international institutions and the reform of existing ones. He emphasizes the importance of civil society organizations, which can act as a counterweight to the power of nation-states and corporations. He also advocates for an international criminal court and a global tax system that would ensure that those who benefit from global economic activity pay their fair share. Ultimately, Zielonka's book is an appeal for us to think differently about how we can address the world's problems. It is an invitation to move beyond the limited vision of nation-states and to embrace a more global perspective.
