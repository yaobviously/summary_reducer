onthe edge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but,though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign.Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with awooden placard slung out through the second window. "Mordecai Smith"was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, "Boats tohire by the hour or day." A second inscription above the doorinformed us that a steam launch was kept,--a statement which wasconfirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmeslooked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression."This looks bad," said he. "These fellows are sharper than Iexpected. They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear,been preconcerted management here."He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and alittle, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by astoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand."You come back and be washed, Jack," she shouted. "Come back, youyoung imp; for if your
father comes home and finds you like that,he'll let us hear of it.""Dear little chap!" said Holmes, strategically. "What a rosy-cheekedyoung rascal! Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?"The youth pondered for a moment. "I'd like a shillin'," said he."Nothing you would like better?""I'd like two shillin' better," the prodigy answered, after somethought."Here you are, then! Catch!--A fine child, Mrs. Smith!""Lor' bless you, sir, he is that, and forward. He gets a'most toomuch for me to manage, 'specially when my man is away days at atime.""Away, is he?" said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. "I am sorry forthat, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.""He's been away since yesterday mornin', sir, and, truth to tell, Iam beginnin' to feel frightened about him. But if it was about aboat, sir, maybe I could serve as well.""I wanted to hire his steam launch.""Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone.That's what puzzles me; for I know there ain't more coals in her
thanwould take her to about Woolwich and back. If he'd been away in thebarge I'd ha' thought nothin'; for many a time a job has taken him asfar as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin' there he might ha'stayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?""He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.""He might, sir, but it weren't his way. Many a time I've heard himcall out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, Idon't like that wooden-legged man, wi' his ugly face and outlandishtalk. What did he want always knockin' about here for?""A wooden-legged man?" said Holmes, with bland surprise."Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that's called more'n once formy old man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what'smore, my man knew he was comin', for he had steam up in the launch. Itell you straight, sir, I don't feel easy in my mind about it.""But, my dear Mrs. Smith," said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, "Youare frightening yourself about
