histhroat. His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathingwas painfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel hisshoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He hada colored scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his facesave a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, andlong gray side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of arespectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty."What is it, my man?" I asked.He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age."Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?" said he."No; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you havefor him.""It was to him himself I was to tell it," said he."But I tell you that I am acting for him. Was it about MordecaiSmith's boat?""Yes. I knows well where it is. An' I knows where the men he is afterare. An' I knows where the treasure is. I knows all about it.""Then tell me, and I shall let him know.""It was to him I was to
tell it," he repeated, with the petulantobstinacy of a very old man."Well, you must wait for him.""No, no; I ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr.Holmes ain't here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself.I don't care about the look of either of you, and I won't tell aword."He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him."Wait a bit, my friend," said he. "You have important information,and you must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like ornot, until our friend returns."The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as AthelneyJones put his broad back up against it, he recognized the uselessnessof resistance."Pretty sort o' treatment this!" he cried, stamping his stick. "Icome here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in mylife, seize me and treat me in this fashion!""You will be none the worse," I said. "We shall recompense you forthe loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will nothave long to
wait."He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his faceresting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.Suddenly, however, Holmes's voice broke in upon us."I think that you might offer me a cigar too," he said.We both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to uswith an air of quiet amusement."Holmes!" I exclaimed. "You here! But where is the old man?""Here is the old man," said he, holding out a heap of white hair."Here he is,--wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguisewas pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand thattest.""Ah, you rogue!" cried Jones, highly delighted. "You would have madean actor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, andthose weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week. I thought I knewthe glint of your eye, though. You didn't get away from us so easily,you see.""I have been working in that get-up all day," said he, lighting hiscigar. "You see, a good many of the criminal

Sherlock Holmes was not present when an old man came to the door looking for him.

After revealing his true identity, he was offered a cigar and the old man's information was revealed.
