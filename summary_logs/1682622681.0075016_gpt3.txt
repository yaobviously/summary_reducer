All day he would wander about as blackas thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good forhim."One night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in myhut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way totheir quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never farapart. The major was raving about his losses."'It's all up, Morstan,' he was saying, as they passed my hut. 'Ishall have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.'"'Nonsense, old chap!' said the other, slapping him upon theshoulder. 'I've had a nasty facer myself, but--' That was all I couldhear, but it was enough to set me thinking.A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so Itook the chance of speaking to him."'I wish to have your advice, major,' said I."'Well, Small, what is it?' he asked, taking his cheroot from hislips."'I wanted to ask you, sir,' said I, 'who is the proper person towhom hidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half amillion worth
lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhapsthe best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the properauthorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortenedfor me.'"'Half a million, Small?' he gasped, looking hard at me to see if Iwas in earnest."'Quite that, sir,--in jewels and pearls.

'It's good enough to act upon?'"Captain Morstan nodded."'Look here, Small,' said the major.
