Longtermism is a philosophical concept that suggests making decisions today to benefit future generations. It has been met with skepticism, as some argue it ignores the suffering of today's individuals and others question whether those who profess longtermism are even capable of it. This debate examines the pros and cons of advancing immunology in light of the potential for rogue actors to exploit this knowledge. Gradual: The Case for Incremental Change in a Radical Age is a book that defends the benefits of muddling through, presenting successful examples of gradual reform and citing Amaras Law which states that we usually overestimate what a new technology can accomplish in the short run and underestimate what it can accomplish in the longer run. This book provides an interesting insight into the benefits of an incrementalist view, but does not consider cases in which this view may fail us and does not explore how different spheres of society may require different ethics of urgency and complacency, and of long- and short-term thinking.
