This proposal outlines a way to enable capitalists to invest in sacred ventures without compromising their sanctity. It suggests a distinction between sacred and profane assets, and outlines possible problems with the proposal such as disagreements over what are considered sacred ends, and what non-sacred services can be sold by sacred ventures. Tax and accounting rules are discussed in order to prevent the laundering of assets, and the proposal suggests prohibiting trades between sacred money and ordinary money in order to protect the sacred image of all sacred capitalists. This proposal provides a way to allow capitalism to induce adaptation and innovation for sacred assets, while protecting their sanctity.
